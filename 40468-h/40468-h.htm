<p>Writing in London
on a day in winter
with a murky sky and sloshy
streets, the title of Alpine
Photography is verily refreshing.
It brings back
days of sunlight and joyous
experiment, and as we write
the soul stirring scenery is
before us called up by photographs
taken under varying
conditions of comfort and
discomfort. That there is
something different in Alpine
photography to photography
in our own country, we are
bound to believe, since a
special article is demanded
for it.</p>

<p>The first question invariably
asked is as to the
nature of the outfit required. We should here like
to divide our reply into two divisions. The one concerning
the mountaineer, and the other the ordinary
tourist. For the former we have no doubt in our minds
that a hand camera to take &frac14; plate or 5 × 4 pictures is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0010" id="p0010">10</a></span>
the most convenient form of camera to take. It is not
our business to advertise any person's wares and we shall
content ourselves by saying that personally we prefer a
camera which has separate slides and does not possess a
magazine, more particularly when glass plates are to be
used, though a form of Kodak is not to be despised.
But perhaps we are prejudiced in favour of glass plates,
for they are simple to manipulate and have no cockles nor
other drawbacks which the careless photographer may
have to encounter. Probably the most useful lens to
employ is a doublet of which the focal length is about a
quarter more than the width of the plate, since it includes
a fair angle and the margins of the photographs are
not likely to be markedly different in general density
to the centre, as is the case when wide-angle lenses
are employed. In England a lens which will cover
with a large stop, say <i>f</i>/8, is a desideratum, but
in the Alps it is very rarely that such a large ratio
of aperture to focal length is required. As a rule
for ordinary plates a lens has to be stopped down to <i>f</i>/16
to give a negative in say <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of a second. Nevertheless
where orthochromatic plates are to be employed it is
very necessary to have a lens which will cover a plate
satisfactorily with <i>f</i>/8 in order to use a colour screen
for producing orthochromatic effects, since the loss of
photographic light caused by the screen can only be
compensated for by such an aperture even when the
shutter is slowed down. The reader is therefore recommended
on the whole to furnish himself with one of the
modern lenses which work at <i>f</i>/8, though he must
remember that the larger the aperture employed the more
the margins and centre of the picture will suffer from
unequal exposure. With some hand cameras there is a
means of attachment to a stand, but a stand on a
mountain is difficult to use and moreover has on more<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0011" id="p0011">11</a></span>
than one occasion been proved dangerous to carry. The
mountaineer if he desires to give a time&mdash;and not an
instantaneous&mdash;exposure on his excursion, would do well
to have a small clip ready to attach to the head of his ice
axe. The axe will form a sufficiently stable stand for
the more prolonged, but still short, exposure that he may
be required to give on some particular subjects such as
a photograph at sunrise or near sunset.</p>

<p>Photographers in England are rarely afflicted with
breathlessness through exertion, but it is different in
mountaineering. A mountaineer may keep his wind,
but it would be rare to find that his heart was beating
equably after some spurt of exertion, such as rock
climbing. It is often after some such exertion that
he comes upon some view which he may wish to
record on his photographic plate. The usual method
of holding the hand camera would under such
circumstances prove a failure so far as sharpness of
image is concerned. Pressed against his "middle" or
"upper" chest, the beatings of the heart will record
themselves on the photograph. Under such circumstances
resort must be had to some form of support on
which to rest his camera. After many years' experience,
the writer has come to the conclusion that there is no
support superior to the ice axe. It is not necessary to
cause it to stand upright in the ground, ice, or snow,
though this should be done if possible. It will suffice to
rest the point on the rock, and place the camera on the
axe head, with the pick parallel to the body. We then
have a firm support in one direction, and the hands,
which are not affected by the automatic motion of the
heart, can be trusted to keep it steady in the other
direction. Photographs taken with a good lens, and
with such a stand, will bear enlarging up to 22 inches, at
least. It is because these photographs will bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0012" id="p0012">12</a></span>
enlarging that a small plate is recommended to the
mountaineer. There is not a large proportion of
Alpine views taken on the mountain side of which one
would care to have anything but a memorandum, and it
is such a size as that recommended which gives such a
memento, and which, if desired, allows a more formidable
size to be acquired at home, where we may suppose
there are all the conveniences that a photographic
laboratory affords. The writer has had experience on
mountains with cameras varying from 12 × 10 to
the &frac14; plate size. When younger and more inclined
to waste a few valuable minutes of daylight in
putting up a camera stand, the 12 × 10 gave pictures
which we often lamented having taken, whilst in his
more mature years, a snap-shot has never been regretted.
The cameras which require stands, require one porter at
least to carry them, for although the late Mr. Donkin
carried his own 7&frac12; × 5 camera up the highest peaks, it is
few men, who, even if they had the energy or the
physique that he had, would imitate his example.
A porter means an extra expense in fees, and an extra
mouth to feed, and very likely entails slowness in a
climb through having an additional man upon the rope.
A quarter plate or a 5 × 4 camera the owner, however,
can himself carry; but the best form of attaching it to
his body has been a difficult task to evolve. Many and
many different attachments have been tried. One thing
is quite certain, and that is, the camera should be in a
stout case, but it cannot be carried over the shoulders by
a strap as we can do in comparatively level countries.
Let anyone try to come down a rock with the camera
slung over his shoulders, and he will soon find it
dangling in front of his stomach, or swinging like a
pendulum, and threatening to displace him from what
at best may be a treacherous handhold. The method<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0013" id="p0013">13</a></span>
of attachment we adopt now, will be readily seen from
the diagram.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Knapsack Carry Method">
	<a name="cp0013" id="cp0013" ></a>
<img src="images/cp0013-400.png" width="400" height="205" alt="Knapsack Carry Method" />
</div>

<p>The shoulder strap is utilized, but a ring is attached
to the back of the case as shown, and a strap or piece of
whipcord comes over the strap as shown. The two
shoulders are in AA and the case is carried as a knapsack.
The length of the cord or strap BB is so adjusted,
as is also the length of the shoulder strap, that the
camera lies against the small of the back, and that it
will not swing away from the body. At one time the
ring was placed in front of the case, but the result was
merely to cause the top of the case to rest against the
back. The plan shown above has answered under
almost every variety of circumstances, and the weight
is inconsiderable. (A friend has his camera attached to
the bottom of a small "rücksac" and this answers,
but as the writer does not carry his own provisions or
change of garments he has not adopted this plan). A
long day's march may be undertaken if this contrivance
be employed, and the weight is scarcely felt.</p>

<p>For those who have not had extensive practice with
hand cameras, a view finder is, if not a necessity, at all
events, a great help. On the whole, perhaps the best form
is that in which a miniature view falls on a ground glass.
It must be recollected, however, that each view finder is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0014" id="p0014">14</a></span>
adapted for some particular focal length of lens. The
view in the finder and on the plate should be compared,
and if the former is more extensive, the surplus ground
glass should be covered up with a black mask.</p>

<p>If it be determined to take a camera with its stand,
very few directions are required beyond those which
apply to ordinary view work on the plains. It may
perhaps be as well to mention that a camera stand placed
on ice or snow, is not immovable until the iron shoes of
the legs attain the temperature of the surrounding snow
or ice. An exposure of a few seconds will often show an
image which has moved on the plate.</p>

<p>The next point that we may call attention to is the
plate to be employed. With a hand camera there is
no absolute necessity to have the most rapid plate,
as far as exposure is concerned, but in mountain
work it must be recollected that there are very great
contrasts to represent on the print. "The slower the
plate the steeper the gradation" is almost axiomatic,
and it must be recollected that only a certain amount
of opacity will print if the deepest shadows only are
to be kept of the greatest black obtainable in a print.
It is evident that the greater the range of light and
shade that is obtained of a printable density, the more
true to nature the picture will be. For this reason a
quick plate with a moderate gradation is to be preferred&mdash;as
being most generally useful&mdash;but it should be a plate
which is absolutely free from fog, and it should also be
of as fine a grain as possible, the size of which has something
to do with development. This is still more true when
a camera stand and hand exposures are made. With a
slow plate with feebler intensities of light, which must be
the case when the lens is stopped down to admit of hand
exposures, the gradation becomes more steep than if a
fairly bright light be employed. A quick plate does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0015" id="p0015">15</a></span>
suffer in the same way, however small the stop may be.
It has already been stated that isochromatic plates may
be employed with a hand camera. For ice and snow
views there is not much to commend their employment,
unless to give a deeper shade to the sky and to the vast
crevasses which so often form part of the foreground.
The darker sky allows faint clouds to be visible in a
print when they otherwise would be absent. Pictorially
thus the isochromatic plate has something to recommend
it. Celluloid films have often been substituted for plates
by the writer, and excellent photographs have been
obtained on them when they were fairly rapid. There
is not much to be said in their favour as regards weight, for
in most cameras the support for them weighs nearly as
much as the glass plate. There is also a disadvantage
in developing them, for they are not so easily manipulated
as a rigid body. For convenience in travelling, however,
they are to be highly commended. A gross of cut films
do not weigh so much as a dozen plates and occupy much
less space in the baggage. The question of the use of a
Kodak camera with its roller slide, has not been brought
forward, not because excellent results cannot be obtained
with it, but simply because the writer prefers to use
plates and films which can be got at any time for the
purpose of development.</p>

<p>For travelling on the continent, and to one's
mountain destination, experience has shown that a small
hamper is the safest receptacle of all the necessary kit.
A hamper which will contain two camera cases side by
side is really sufficient; but it should be a little greater
in depth. It may be thought that two cameras are to
be taken, but such is not the intention. If a zinc trough
be made of the size of one camera case it will contain all
the developing apparatus necessary, the lantern, and the
plates or films, and all the few etceteras which go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0016" id="p0016">16</a></span>
make one happy. (A screwdriver, a file, and some
extra screws, and gummed paper and white blotting
paper cut to the size of the plates should be enough for
the etceteras). The hamper may be arranged so that the
camera and view finder may be taken out without any
derangement of the rest of the articles in it. The
developing bottles and cups, with the dishes, may be
similarly extracted. This prevents undue trouble in
unpacking and packing. One grand thing to remember
is, pack well but not distressingly tightly, in other words
don't employ an expert packer if you wish for comfort.
Have the hamper a size too large rather than a size too
small. Also be it remembered that it is useless to
stopper the bottles with all sorts of devices at home, and
have to pack in an ordinary manner when once the
contents of the hamper have been brought into use.
Have your bottles covered with an indiarubber cap
which can easily be removed and replaced; of course
we are assuming that development is to take place
during one's travels, and not to be left over for home.
Personally we think that a speedy development after
a view is taken will give the best picture. It may
often happen that an undeveloped sensitive plate or
film will suffer by its travels. There will or may be
scratches and what not, which would be absent if the
negative is finished at the time. The outfit for
development which need only be taken is as follows:
four developing dishes, bottles or cartridges of the dry
developer, ammonia diluted to half its strength in a glass
stoppered bottle (if in a wooden case, as for medicine
bottles, it will be a further protection), a couple of tins
of hyposulphite <i>pounded up</i> before the journey, carried
in small tins (such tins as the half-plate platinum
paper comes in are very convenient), two or three empty
six ounce medicine bottles with good corks, a two or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0017" id="p0017">17</a></span>
ounce measure, a washing rack with a trough (there is
a folding rack in the market which answers admirably;
it has <b>v</b> shaped grooves which never damage the edges of
the film, and one rack will take twenty-two glasses back
to back). A zinc trough can be made to cover
the plates with water when in the rack, a lantern
(by preference a paper folding one), a dusting brush,
a couple of dusters, and blotting paper cut into
squares the size of the plates, with which to
pack them&mdash;it is useful also to have spare pieces of
blotting paper to place beneath the plates when drying,
also a piece of mackintosh to place on the wash stand
during developing operations&mdash;an empty pint wine bottle
will be got at any hotel and in this the hyposulphite can
be dissolved. The list looks formidable but the whole
can be readily packed in the hamper of the size given.
It will be seen that no intensifying solutions are
enumerated amongst the requisites. A negative is better
strengthened in the quiet of one's dark-room at home.</p>

<p>Now we must give a hint or two as to the exposures
required. We will suppose that on the plates to be
used a satisfactory negative of an open English landscape,
on a bright June day with fleecy clouds in the
sky, can be secured with an aperture of <i>f</i>/11 in <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub>th of
a second. If that be so, then on an equally fine day in
July or August, at an altitude of about 6000 feet, the
same kind of view should theoretically be secured in <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th
second, and a stop of <i>f</i>/16&mdash;that is, the photographic light is
about four times as strong. It must, however, be
recollected that at this altitude, and particularly near
mid-day, the shadows are not illuminated to the same
degree from the sky. The darker blue sky shows that
the light which at a low altitude goes to make a pale
blue sky is to be found in the direct rays of the sun,
and not scattered to give a luminous sky. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0018" id="p0018">18</a></span>
shadows are principally illuminated by the light from the
sky, it follows that the shadows will be darker at a high
than at a low altitude, for this reason amongst others,
the exposure should not be curtailed to the amount given
above. If the aperture be reduced to <i>f</i>/16 it is probable
that the exposure of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub>th second will be not more than
sufficient to give. For our own part we prefer to give
longer and to expose well for the deep shadows, trusting
to development to give us properly "gradated"
pictures. As the sun goes down toward the horizon, the
shadows get more illumined from local reflection, and it
is scarcely necessary to alter the exposure until considerably
nearer sunset than at home, when the exposure must
be considerably prolonged. For views in which
there is little but ice and snow, the exposure
should be very much curtailed. There is so
little contrast that if the exposure be at all
prolonged the picture will be inevitably flat. The
shadows are illumined by an immense quantity of light
reflected from the white surface, and the difficulty is to
get sufficient contrast. The writer well remembers one
set of beautiful views, taken from the top of a mountain
some 10,000 feet high, where the eye could see nothing
but snow-fields and ice and swirling masses of clouds.
The day was not bright, but to get a satisfactory picture a
stop of <i>f</i>/32 was necessary with only an exposure of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>70</sub>th
of a second. Plates given an exposure of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25</sub>th second
with a stop <i>f</i>/16 showed little besides a plain white mass.
It would be difficult to give hints for every kind of view.
The judgment of the operator must be brought into play
and no actinometer will be of much use under the varied
conditions which are the rule, not the exception.</p>

<p>Now as to development. The "one-solution" given
by the metol and amidol cartridges are the most readily
prepared, and in five times out of six will scarcely be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0019" id="p0019">19</a></span>
bettered, but for the sixth time may fail, because of their
"rigidity." For these exceptional negatives, solutions of
an oxidizing agent such as pyrogallol, of a restrainer
(bromide), and of an accelerator are to be recommended.
For the latter, the carbonate (not the bicarbonate) of
potash is much to be recommended, though some prefer
ammonia. Two formulæ are given, either of which will
be found extremely useful. When the exposure has
been prolonged enough for details in deep shadows to
be brought out, it will generally happen that over-exposure
has been given to the high-lights, and it is to
keep these in the printing state that care is required.
In the old collodion dry plate days, it was very usual to
bring out a complete phantom image of a subject before
any density was given to it. When this was properly
out, the intensifier of silver nitrate and pyrogallol was
applied, and the picture gradually brought up to printing
density. It was usually full of detail in the high-lights
and shadows, all of which would be found in the finished
print. Such is the same procedure which we
recommend, strive to get out an image of feeble density
but full of detail, and then give the density.</p>

<p>The plate should first of all be thoroughly soaked in
a solution of the alkali which can be used, and then a
few drops of the pyrogallol solution be dropped into the
developing cup with an equal number of drops of the
restrainer. The alkaline solution is then returned to the
cup and again poured into the dish and over the plate.
By degrees the required phantom image will make its
appearance, and now bromide and pyrogallol are added
until it is evidently complete. The plate is then washed
in water, a final wash being given in a very weak
solution of acetic acid or citric and water. After a final
rinse with water the plate is treated with the pyrogallol
solution and restrainer in the proportion recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0020" id="p0020">20</a></span>
for the ordinary development of the plate, omitting the
alkali. The density will begin to appear, and when it
flags, a little alkali is added (a few drops at a time) to the
solution. Keep the image fairly feeble at above half the
proper printing density, and fix. The plate should then
be kept for intensification, preferably by Mr. Chapman
Jones's, when a mercury solution is applied, and then a
ferrous oxalate to reduce the latter to the metallic state.
It will be found if this procedure is adopted, that the
negative is built up with a greater range of light
gradation than by bringing it out by a one-solution
method of development. If one wishes to exercise
artistic treatment, then in the preliminary stage more
importance can be given to any desired part by
applying a camel's hair brush soaked in normal pyrogallol
solution with its restrainer. The prominence thus
gained will be kept in the subsequent operations.
When applying the brush care must be taken that the
image blends as it were with the rest of the picture.
No abrupt increase of density must be permitted, as if
it be, the result will be anything but satisfactory.</p>

<p>This table and the preceding one will enable a
calculation to be made as to the exposure to be given.
Thus at sea level with a photographic brightness of
sun of 639,000 candles when nearly overhead, it will at
5° above the horizon only have a photographic brightness
of about 1000. At about 9000 feet high the photographic
brightness would when the sun is overhead be
about 800,000 candles, and at 5° it would have a value
of 350,000, showing the greater penetration through the
thinner atmosphere.</p>

<p>When a sensitive
plate has been
properly exposed under
ordinary conditions, there
is no visible change. The
action of light produces
what is known as a <i>latent
image</i> or <i>developable image</i>,
and in order to convert
this into a visible image
with sufficient opacity to
be useful for printing purposes,
it must be <i>developed</i>.
In the operation of development,
the plate is treated
with some solution that
will act on the exposed
parts of the sensitive film
and reduce the silver salts
contained therein to metallic
silver, in quantity proportional
to the amount of
light-action, whilst at the same time it produces no
appreciable change in those parts of the film on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0024" id="p0024">24</a></span>
light has acted the least or not at all, and which correspond
to the darkest shadows of the object that has been
photographed. The solution used for this purpose is
called the <i>developer</i>.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEVELOPERS&mdash;GENERAL.</p>

<p>The substances that can be employed as photographic
developers are now somewhat numerous, but
the most useful for negative making are pyrogallic acid
(also known as pyrogallol, or for brevity as pyro.), ortol,
metol, and hydroquinone (also known as quinol).
Ferrous oxalate is likewise used in special circumstances,
but not for general work. An ordinary developer as
mixed for use contains:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

	<p>1.&mdash;One of the above-mentioned substances (pyrogallic
acid, ortol, metol, quinol) which is the actual
developing constituent, and is known as <i>the
reducer</i>, but requires the addition of the next
constituent before it can work.</p>

	<p>2.&mdash;An alkali, which may be sodium carbonate,
potassium carbonate, caustic soda, caustic potash,
or, if pyrogallic acid is used, ammonia. The
alkali sets the reducer in action and is called
<i>the accelerator</i>.</p>

	<p>3.&mdash;A soluble bromide, which must be potassium
bromide except when ammonia is used as the
alkali, and then it may be ammonium bromide.
The chief use of the bromide is to retard the
action of the developer, and in particular to

the solution from becoming strongly discoloured
and consequently staining the film. It also
affects the colour of the reduced silver that forms
the developed image, this colour being browner,

lower the proportion of sulphite present. Sodium
sulphite and potassium metabisulphite are the
most commonly used.</p>

<p>The composition of a developer has to be so
arranged that, whilst reasonably rapid in its action, it is
not so rapid as to be beyond control, and does not
produce "general fog" by acting on those parts of the
film that have not been acted on by light.</p>

<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT&mdash;GENERAL OPERATIONS
AND PHENOMENA.</p>

<p>A developer is usually compounded immediately
before use by mixing two or more solutions, and in
order to ensure uniform action it is essential that the
constituents should be thoroughly mixed before the
liquid is applied to the plate. If the measuring or
mixing vessel is large enough, this can be done by
agitating the liquid; if not, the liquid may be poured
once or twice from one vessel to another.</p>

<p>The quantity of developer necessary for a plate of
a given size depends in some degree upon the size and
character of the dish that is used, and is smallest when
the bottom of the dish is quite flat and has no ridges or
grooves. It is false economy to use too small a quantity,
and it may be taken that for a quarter plate 1&frac12; oz., for
a half plate 2&frac12; or 3 oz., and for a whole plate 4 oz. of
developer should be used.</p>

<p>Ebonite, xylonite, or papier maché dishes are the
best for all operations connected with negative making,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0026" id="p0026">26</a></span>
since they are not so liable as porcelain or earthenware
to break a plate if it is allowed to drop into them.</p>

<p>When applying the developer to the plate it is
important to cover the whole surface of the plate rapidly
and in such a manner as to avoid the formation of air
bubbles, and the best way is to begin to pour on the
developer at one corner of the developing dish and
whilst pouring somewhat quickly move the vessel
rapidly but steadily along the edge of the dish to the
other corner. If there should be any froth or air bubbles
on the surface of the developer, the last portions should
not be poured out of the vessel into the dish, and then
the risk of air bubbles forming on the surface of the
plate will be lessened.</p>

<p>Sometimes after the developer has been poured on
and the plate seems to be uniformly wetted, the liquid
will recede from one corner or one edge of the plate and
the part thus left uncovered will appear as a patch of
lower opacity when the negative is finished. This
happens either because the dish is not standing level on
the table or because the bottom of the dish is not flat;
sometimes it happens because too small a quantity of
developer has been used.</p>

<p>After the plate has been covered by the developer
the dish should be carefully rocked from time to time,
and, for reasons that will be explained presently, the
time required for the first appearance of the image and
the manner in which the different parts of the image
follow one another, should be carefully observed.</p>

<p>If the plate has been correctly exposed, the brightest
parts of the image will appear (as black, of course,) in
about a minute, more or less, according to the temperature,
composition of the developer, and character of the
plate, and the other parts will follow steadily in the
order of their brightness, after which the image as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0027" id="p0027">27</a></span>
whole will continue to gain vigour or opacity up to a
certain limit. The essential point is that the principal
details in the deepest shadows of the subject shall
appear and acquire a distinct printable opacity, before
the highest lights become so opaque that the details in
them are no longer distinguishable. Whether this condition
is realisable or not depends very largely on the
exposure that the plate has received.</p>

<p>If the image appears in considerably less than a
minute and the different parts follow one another very
quickly, the plate has been <i>over-exposed</i>, and the degree
of over-exposure is indicated by the rapidity with which
the image appears. In this connection it ought,
however, to be stated that with metol and certain other
developers, even when the plate has been correctly
exposed, the different parts of the image appear almost
simultaneously, though the first appearance may not
begin until about a minute after the developer has been
applied to the plate. It follows that with these
developers it is difficult to recognise over-exposure, but
it so happens that they are not suitable developers to
use when there is any probability that the plates have
been over-exposed. On the other hand, if the image is
slow in appearing and the brightest parts of the subject
are not followed in due course by the middle tones, the
plate has been <i>under-exposed</i>, and there is considerable
danger that the high-lights may become quite opaque
before any details have appeared in the shadows, or
even, in extreme cases, in the lower middle tones, that
is to say, in those parts that are next in darkness to the
shadows.</p>

<p>When it is desired, as it frequently is, to alter the
composition of the developer during development, the
substance or substances to be added should be put into
the measuring or mixing glass, the developer poured out<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0028" id="p0028">28</a></span>
of the dish into the glass, and the well-mixed liquid
poured over the plate as before. Any attempt to add
substances to the developer whilst it is in contact with
the plate will probably result in uneven action.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that temperature has an
important influence on development, the time required
for the first appearance of the image and for the completion
of development being, as a rule, less the higher
the temperature. Further, if the developing solutions
are very cold, it is often almost impossible to obtain
sufficient opacity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult thing in connection with
development is to know when to stop the process, that
is to say, when the image has acquired sufficient opacity,
or "density," as it is often called. After all the required
detail has become visible, the plate from time to time is
lifted carefully out of the developer, allowed to drain for
a moment or two, and then held between the developing
lamp and the eye; the opacity of the image, especially
in the highest lights and deepest shadows, being
carefully scrutinised. The appearance of the image as
seen when looking at the back of the plate, is also
carefully observed.</p>

<p>For this purpose it is very much better that the
light of the developing lamp should pass through transparent
glass (ruby or deep orange) so that the flame
itself is distinctly visible, instead of through ground glass
or a coloured translucent fabric. Further, the flame of
the lamp, whether gas or oil, should always be turned
up to the same height, for it is clear that if the brightness
of the flame used for making the examination is not
fairly constant, all sorts of variable results will be
obtained. For this reason it is much better to judge
the opacity of negatives by artificial light than by
daylight, the intensity of the latter being so variable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0029" id="p0029">29</a></span>
A paraffin lamp with a circular wick and a deep ruby
chimney with a metal cap at the top, answers admirably.</p>

<p>No general rules can be laid down; the appearance
of the properly developed image depends on the thickness
of the film, the granularity of the silver salt, the presence
or absence of silver iodide, and the composition of the
emulsion used. Experience only is of value, and the
best way to secure uniformly satisfactory results, is to
keep as far as possible to one brand of plates. With
some plates, for example, very little of the image should
appear at the back of the plate, with others the greater
part of the image must be distinctly visible there.</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially when using small sizes of
plates, it is not easy to tell whether all the necessary
detail in the shadows has been brought out, and this is
an important matter, for if the small negatives are to be
used for making enlarged negatives or prints, or lantern
slides, there should be very little clear glass indeed even
in the deepest shadows of the subject. As a rule it may
be said that when every part of the image is at least
gray the maximum possible amount of detail has been
brought out. If the greyness begins to spread to the
margins of the plate where it has been protected by the
rebate of the dark slide, general fog is being produced,
and, as a rule, little will be gained, but much may be
lost, by continuing the development for any considerable
time after this is observed. When development is
completed the developer is poured off, the plate is well
rinsed under the tap or in two or three changes of water,
and is then ready for fixing.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT WITH PYRO-AMMONIA.</p>

<p>This method of development has the advantage that
the constituents can be kept in concentrated solutions,
considerable modifications in the composition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0030" id="p0030">30</a></span>
developer can be made very readily and the negatives
obtained are of excellent printing quality. On the other
hand it cannot be satisfactorily employed with certain
brands of rapid plates, because with them it has a
tendency to produce general fog, and with some other
plates, especially when they are old, it has a tendency to
produce what is known as green fog.</p>

	<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1">
	<span class="label">[1]</span></a> The metabisulphite is dissolved in about 8 oz. (80 parts) of
water with the aid of heat, and the pyrogallic acid is then added.
When the liquid has cooled it is made up to 10 oz. (100 parts) by
addition of water, the whole being well mixed by shaking.</p>
</div>

<p>For each ounce of developer, take 20 minims of
reducer, 20 minims of restrainer and 40 minims of
accelerator, and make up to 1 oz. with water. With
some plates 60 minims of accelerator and 30 minims of
restrainer may be used, but any greater proportion of
accelerator has considerable tendency to produce general
fog. On the other hand the proportion of restrainer can
often be increased with advantage since, unless the
amount added is very large, its chief effect is to prevent
general fog; 30 minims of restrainer to 40 minims of
accelerator, or 40 minims of accelerator to 60 minims of
restrainer are proportions that can be recommended.
Too low a proportion of bromide should be carefully
avoided.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0031" id="p0031">31</a></span>

<p>It is very important to ascertain, by careful trial
with each brand of plates that is to be used, what is the
maximum proportion of ammonia that can safely be
added, and what proportion of bromide to ammonia is
necessary in order to prevent general fog. As a rule,
the more rapid the plates the smaller is the quantity of
ammonia that can be used with safety.</p>

<p>By far the best plan is to keep development well
under control by adding only part of the accelerator at
the beginning of development and adding the rest as
circumstances require.</p>

<p>For each ounce of developer take 20 minims of
pyro solution and make up to the required bulk with
water. In another measure mix for each ounce of
developer 40 minims of bromide solution and 60 minims
of ammonia solution, and regard this as the maximum
quantity that can be added with that bulk of developer.
Now to the diluted pyro solution add about a quarter
or one-third of the ammonia and bromide solution, pour
this mixture on the plate and observe what happens.</p>

<p>If the mode of appearance of the image indicates
that the plate has been correctly exposed, about half the
remaining ammonia and bromide mixture may be added
to the developer at once, and the action allowed to continue,
with occasional rocking of the dish. If development
proceeds satisfactorily and, in particular, if the
chief details in the shadows begin to appear before the
highest lights have become too opaque, it is not necessary
nor advisable to add the last portion of the ammonia
and bromide mixture, since the tendency to general fog
and green fog is reduced when the proportion of ammonia
is kept as low as possible. On the other hand, if
the development flags and the appearance of shadow
detail is a little tardy, the rest of the ammonia and
bromide mixture must be added.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0032" id="p0032">32</a></span>

<p>If the plate seems to be over-exposed, no more of
the ammonia and bromide mixture should be added for
some time, until it is seen whether the quantity already
in the developer will suffice to complete development.
If it seems that the over-exposure has been considerable,
a further quantity of pyro solution (10 to 20 minims per
oz.) and also of bromide solution (10, 20, or 30 minims
per oz.) may be added with advantage. Development
is then allowed to continue and the negative is examined
from time to time; if it is seen that the opacity does
not increase, or if sufficient detail in the deep shadows
does not appear, further small quantities of the ammonia
and bromide mixture may be added <i>cautiously</i> until the
required result is obtained, waiting a little while to see
the result of each small addition before adding more.</p>

<p>When the plate behaves as if under-exposed, dilute
the developer at once with half the quantity or an equal
quantity of water, according to the degree of under-exposure
indicated, and add the whole of the ammonia
and bromide mixture. These modifications should check
the rate at which the high-lights of the subject gain
opacity, whilst accelerating the appearance of the
middle tones and shadows. Should this effect not be
produced, further quantities of ammonia and bromide
mixture may be added or, in extreme cases, ammonia
alone, and the developer may be still more diluted with
water.</p>

<p>If any considerable parts of the image still show no
detail, local development with a brush may be tried as a
last resource. A soft camel's hair brush, preferably
mounted in quill, is used. Some of the ammonia and
bromide mixture is placed in a vessel and diluted with
two or three times its volume of water. One corner or
edge of the plate is raised so that the part to be treated
is lifted out of the developer, the diluted ammonia and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0033" id="p0033">33</a></span>
bromide mixture is applied rapidly with the brush, and
the plate is allowed to drop gently back into the
developer. The treatment may be repeated if necessary.</p>

<p>Should all these devices
fail, the plate is hopelessly
under-exposed.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when working
with a diluted developer as
just described, it happens that
although all the necessary
detail has been brought out,
the image gains in opacity very
slowly. Provided that all the
required detail is visible, small
quantities of pyro solution
may be added in order to gain
opacity more quickly.</p>

<p class="center">PYRO-SODA DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>When sodium carbonate
is used as the alkali in place
of ammonia the developer acts
somewhat more slowly and is
less liable to produce fog, especially
with very rapid plates,
and there is very little tendency
to produce green fog. On the
other hand, variations are not
so easily made in the composition
of the developer.

<p>This developer behaves in much the same way as
pyro-soda and gives very similar results. It has the
advantage, however, that it does not stain the fingers,
and has practically no tendency to produce either fog or
stain on the plates. Moreover the same quantity of
solution can be used for several plates; when the action
becomes perceptibly slower or weaker, part of the old
solution is poured away and an equal quantity of freshly

<p>The chief differences to be observed are (1) that the
different parts of the image follow one another more

must be carried a little further.</p>

<p>Mix two parts of hydroquinone solution with one
part of alkali solution and one part of water, or, if a
more energetic developer is wanted, mix equal volumes
of the hydroquinone and alkali solutions. Hydroquinone
is not an advantageous developer for general
purposes, but it is useful when negatives are required
showing strong contrast between the highest lights and
the deepest shadows, and especially when it is important
that there should be no deposit at all in the deepest
shadows. This is the case, for example, when copying
line engravings, pen and ink drawings and similar
subjects.</p>

<p>This method of development also is not well
adapted for general work, but it is invaluable for certain
purposes. The reduced silver has a pure grey-black
colour and there is exceedingly little tendency to
produce fog of any kind. On the other hand, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0037" id="p0037">37</a></span>
developer admits of little modification in its composition
and therefore the exposure must be fairly correct. It is
also important to avoid contamination with even minute
quantities of hypo, since this substance very readily
causes stains.</p>

be in clear pale green crystals without any yellowish
incrustation, is dissolved in it with the aid of a gentle
heat. After the solution has cooled, it is made up to

when exposed to air, and should, therefore, be kept in

<p>For use take four parts of oxalate solution and one
part of ferrous sulphate solution, pouring the latter into
the former and <i>not vice versa</i>. In order to obtain slower
action with a rather softer image and a slightly browner
deposit, the developer may be diluted with an equal
volume of water. Slower action, with slightly increased
printing contrasts, and clearer shadows, results from
an increase in the proportion of bromide.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">FIXING.</p>

<p>After development is finished, the dark-coloured
reduced silver that forms the image remains mixed with
a considerable quantity of semi-opaque, yellowish<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0038" id="p0038">38</a></span>
unaltered silver bromide, which would not only interfere
with the printing, but would also gradually darken
when exposed to light. The negative must therefore be
"fixed" by dissolving out the unaltered silver bromide,
and this is accomplished by immersing the plate in a
fairly strong solution of sodium thiosulphate (formerly
called sodium hyposulphite) commonly known as
"hypo." The usual strength of the fixing is as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

		<td class="tdl">parts</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>A solution of double this strength is, however, not
unfrequently used, and acts more rapidly, especially in
cold weather.</p>

<p>The developed plate, after being well rinsed with
water, is placed in the fixing bath and allowed to remain
in it with frequent rocking until the silver bromide has
all been dissolved out of the film. This is ascertained
by lifting the plate out of the dish and looking at the
back by reflected light, the plate being held in front of
something dark. It is not difficult to see whether the
silver bromide has all disappeared or not, but in order
to ensure complete fixing the plate must not be taken
out of the bath as soon as this has happened, but
should be left in for a few minutes longer, the dish
being rocked so that the dissolved silver salt may
diffuse out of the film into the fixing bath.</p>

<p>When removed from the fixing bath the plate
should be allowed to drain into the bath for a few
moments and should then be washed for five or ten
minutes in running water under the tap. It is best to
put the plate in a dish standing on the sink and have a
piece of flexible indiarubber tubing reaching from the
tap to within a couple of inches or so of the top of
the dish, so that the water may not splash too much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0039" id="p0039">39</a></span>
After washing in this way, the plate is placed in a
grooved zinc rack, which is immersed in a tank (preferably
of zinc), containing sufficient water to completely
cover the plates, and here it remains until the whole
batch of plates in hand has been developed and they
can all receive their final washing together. The plates
stand upright in the rack, and the entrance and exit of
the water must be so arranged that the water enters at
the bottom and overflows at the top, or, what is perhaps
better, enters at the top and is drawn off from the
bottom, the waste pipe opening at the bottom of the
tank and being bent and carried upwards until its
mouth is at the level at which the water is to stand in
the tank.</p>

<p>When running water is not available the plates
may be washed in dishes. After being well rinsed
to remove the adhering hypo solution, the plate is
covered with water (about 3&frac12; oz. for a half plate or 5 oz.
for a whole plate) and allowed to remain with frequent
rocking for five or six minutes. The water is then well
drained off, a second quantity added and allowed to
remain for the same time as before, with frequent
rocking, when it is poured off in its turn. Treatment in
this way with six successive quantities of water will
remove all the hypo, provided that the film has not been
treated with alum.</p>

<p>Another plan, rather less troublesome, but also less
expeditious, is to place the rack containing the plates in
a tank not much more than big enough to hold it,
taking care that there is not less than two inches
between the lower edges of the plates and the bottom of
the tank. After standing for some time the rack and
the plates are slowly and carefully lifted out and
allowed to drain, the tank emptied and filled with fresh
water, and the rack and plates then replaced. Eight or<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0040" id="p0040">40</a></span>
ten successive quantities of water applied in this way
should remove all the hypo, but if there is any doubt on
this point the plates, after they are supposed to be
washed and have been removed from the tank, should
be allowed to drain into a measuring glass or into a dish,
the contents of which are afterwards transferred to a
measuring glass and mixed with a small quantity of a
solution of silver nitrate. If the plates are really completely
washed nothing will happen, or at most a white
precipitate will be produced which <i>will remain white</i> if
not exposed to daylight. If, on the other hand, the
plates still retain hypo, the silver nitrate will produce a
precipitate which will gradually become orange and
eventually dark brown. Should this happen, the
washing must be continued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Drying.</span>&mdash;If the negatives are allowed to dry in the
rack in which they were washed, the process is slow,
and sometimes if the washing has not been complete,
the middle portions of the negatives, which dry last, are
less opaque than the rest. An excellent method of
drying negatives rapidly and in such a way that no dust
can fall on the film, is to drive nails (preferably of copper)
into a wall or a board fixed against the wall, at distances
apart depending on the size of the plates. Each plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0041" id="p0041">41</a></span>
then rests, with the film downwards, between a pair of
nails, the lower corner of the plate resting against the
wall, as shown on previous page.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alum Bath.</span>&mdash;It is frequently recommended that
all plates should be immersed in a strong solution of
alum, for the purpose of preventing "frilling" by
hardening the film. Its use is, however, attended with
the great disadvantage that liquids diffuse into and out
of a film so treated with much greater difficulty than in
the case of an ordinary film, and consequently if the
film is alumed between development and fixing, the
fixing is not only much slower, but the washing after
fixing requires a very much longer time. If, therefore,
the alum bath is used at all, it should not be applied
until after the film has been well washed after fixing.
The following solution may be used:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

<p>If a strong solution of alum is applied to the plate for a
long time, the film may become so thoroughly hardened
that it partially loses its adhesiveness, and there is a
possibility that it will begin to peel from the glass
after the negatives have been stored for some time in a
dry place. The solution given above is quite strong
enough and plates need not be immersed in it for more
than five minutes, after which they must, of course, be
again well washed. The hardening of the film, if not
carried too far, no doubt makes it less liable to be
injured by abrasion and the like.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frilling.</span>&mdash;It sometimes happens that during the
various operations of development, fixing and washing,
the film begins to leave the plate and rise in puckers
along the edges. This is known as "frilling," and in
bad cases it may spread until a large part of the film<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0042" id="p0042">42</a></span>
has detached itself from the glass. It is due to excessive
or irregular absorption of water by the gelatine, and at
one time was commonly met with, but it rarely occurs
with the dry plates of the present day. It is most likely
to arise if there is any considerable difference of
temperature between the various liquids and the wash-water,
or during very hot weather when all the liquids
are much warmer than usual.</p>

<p>When frilling does occur, the plate must be treated
carefully, so as to avoid tearing the film, but unless it is
very bad and shows a tendency to spread, all the
operations, including washing after fixing, should be
completed before any special measures are taken to
remedy the defect. On the other hand, if the frilling
spreads rapidly, the plate should be carefully rinsed two
or three times with water and placed for five minutes
in the alum bath, with occasional gentle rocking, after
which it is again well washed to remove the alum, and
the various operations are completed. There is one
exception to the procedure just indicated; if the frilling
becomes bad while the plate is being fixed or during
washing after fixing, the alum must not be applied until
the fixing and the washing after fixing are completed.
If something must be done in these circumstances, the
plate, after draining, but without any previous washing,
may be placed for about ten minutes in a saturated
solution of common salt. It can afterwards be put
back into the fixing bath, also without any intermediate
washing, and the remainder of the process carried
through.</p>

<p>Although the methods just described will check the
frilling, they will not remove its effects. For this
purpose the plate after its final washing is allowed to
drain thoroughly and is then immersed in methylated
alcohol, preferably of the old kind, though the new kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0043" id="p0043">43</a></span>
can be made to do. The alcohol abstracts water from
the film, which consequently shrinks to its original size
and can be pressed back with the fingers into its proper
position on the plate. Should the film be opalescent it
should be removed from the first quantity of alcohol and
placed in a second quantity, after which it should be set
up to dry. The plates should not remain too long in
the alcohol or the gelatine will contract too much.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEFECTS IN NEGATIVES.</p>

<p>A perfect negative presupposes a perfect plate,
correct exposure, and correct development stopped at
exactly the right time. It is almost unnecessary to say
that all these conditions are rarely satisfied, and consequently
most negatives fall more or less short of
perfection. The defects may be broadly grouped under
two heads, namely, those due to imperfections existing
in the film before exposure, and those due to defects or
errors in the way in which the plate has been treated.
It will be more convenient to deal with the latter, and
larger, group first, but there is really no hard and fast
division between them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Negative is Thin</span>, or in other words, whilst
showing good gradation, and sufficient relative contrast
between the different parts, is as a whole lacking in
opacity or printing strength, and gives prints that are
deficient in vigour and contrasts. The plate has been
removed from the developer too soon, and the remedy
is to intensify the image (see <a href="#p0051">p. 51</a>). Sometimes the
want of opacity is due to the fact that the developer
was too cold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Negative is too Dense or Opaque</span> and
consequently although showing good contrasts and
gradations, takes a long time to print, especially on dull
days. The developer has been too energetic, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0044" id="p0044">44</a></span>
development has been continued too long; the remedy
is to reduce the image (see <a href="#p0050">p. 50</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Image is "Flat,"</span> or shows comparatively
little contrast between the highest lights and the
deepest shadows. This may, of course, be due to the
absence of contrasts in the subject photographed; it is
commonly due to over-exposure; it may be caused by
using a developer containing too little reducer, or
restrainer, or both, and too much alkali; sometimes it
arises from a defect in the quality of the emulsion, or
from the fact that the plate has been coated with an
abnormally thin film of emulsion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Image is "Hard,"</span> or shows excessive
contrasts between lights and shadows, and is defective
in the range of its half-tones. This is probably due
to under-exposure, but may have been aggravated by
the use of a developer containing too much bromide
or too little alkali. Local reduction (see <a href="#p0050">p. 50</a>) may
partially remedy the defect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fog.</span>&mdash;A more or less marked grey deposit of
reduced silver extends over the whole surface of the
image. It may be due to over-exposure, in which case
the edges of the plate that have been protected by the
rebate of the dark slide usually remain clear. It may
also be caused by using a developer containing too
much alkali, or too little restrainer, or both, or by the
plate having been exposed to actinic light outside the
camera, including the light from the dark-room lamp if
the glass or coloured fabric used as the screening
material is not efficient. In any of these cases the
defect would be observable up to the extreme edges of
the film.</p>

<p>The character of the dark-room light should be
tested by exposing one half of a plate to it at a distance
of say nine or twelve inches for five or ten minutes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0045" id="p0045">45</a></span>
other half of the plate being protected by some opaque
substance. The best plan is to put the plate into a
dark slide and draw out the shutter half-way. After
exposure the plate is treated with a developer in the
usual manner, and it can then be seen whether or no
the light has exerted any action on the plate.</p>

<p>Slight general fog may as a rule be neglected, but
if the amount of fog is at all considerable the plate
should be treated with a reducer, and afterwards the
image can, if necessary, be intensified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green Fog.</span>&mdash;The surface of the film shows a
peculiar brilliant green or yellowish-green lustrous
appearance, generally in patches, when examined by
reflected light, but is more or less distinctly pink when
the plate is looked through. This effect is rarely
observed except when pyro-ammonia has been used as
the developer, and it most frequently occurs with old
plates, especially if development has been long continued
or has been forced by the addition of comparatively
large quantities of ammonia.</p>

<p>If the green fog is only slight it does not affect the
prints made from the negative, but in bad cases the
prints have a patchy appearance and are less deeply
printed at those points where the green fog is worst.
Two methods are available for the removal of green fog.</p>

<p>In one of these the plate, after being fixed and
washed, is placed in a hypo solution of half the strength
of the ordinary fixing bath, and to this hypo solution is
added a very small quantity of a solution of potassium
ferricyanide, and the mixture is allowed to act on the
plate for some time, the dish being rocked occasionally.
The green fog will gradually disappear and some more
of the ferricyanide may be added, if necessary, to secure
this end, but it is important to keep the proportion of
ferricyanide as low as possible, otherwise the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0046" id="p0046">46</a></span>
itself will be reduced. For this reason, if it is seen or
suspected that the green fog is likely to be bad, development
should be carried a little farther than usual in
order to allow for the slight reduction that accompanies
the removal of the green fog.</p>

<p>The other plan is to immerse the plate in a dilute
solution of ferric chloride (perchloride of iron) until the
green fog has been completely bleached, then wash,
first in a dilute solution of oxalic acid and afterwards in
water, and finally treat with a developer, preferably
ferrous oxalate. The green fog is converted into a
very fine grey deposit which is almost invisible and
has no appreciable effect on the printing qualities of
the negative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Spots</span> may be due to particles of dirt that have
been allowed to lodge on the film during one or other
of the operations, or during drying. They may also be
due to particles in the emulsion, and in the latter case
are generally round and sharply defined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Marks</span> of the nature of irregular streaks,
looking, so to speak, like black scratches, are generally
due to mechanical abrasion of the film. Pressure
produces a developable image similar to that produced
by the action of light.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Black Bands</span>, indistinct or nebulous at the edges, are
sometimes caused during the coating of the plate with
the emulsion, in which case they, as a rule, extend all
the way along or across the plate. More commonly they
are due to defects in the hinges of the dark slides, which
may produce the bands either by allowing light to pass
through, or by giving off exhalations that affect the
plates if they are allowed to remain in the dark slide for
a long time. If the bands are due to the hinges, they
will, of course, correspond with them in position, and if
the hinge is double, in the distance between them.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0047" id="p0047">47</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Transparent Bands</span>, or bands showing less opacity
than the rest of the image, are sometimes caused by
exhalations from the material forming the hinges of the
dark slides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Transparent Spots</span> if small ("pinholes"), are generally
due to the presence of particles of dust on the surface
of the plate when it was exposed. Prevention lies, of
course, in carefully dusting the plate and the dark slide
with a soft, clean, dry camel's hair brush, before putting
the former into the latter. If the spots are larger and
circular, they are due either to the formation of air
bubbles on the surface of the plate during development,
or to the presence in the film of insensitive particles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uneven Opacity or Density</span>, varying gradually
from one end or side of the plate to the opposite end or
side, is due to uneven coating of the plate. If there is a
distinctly defined patch, less opaque than the rest, the
plate was not properly covered by the developing solution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stains.</span>&mdash;A uniform stain, of a yellowish or brown
colour, is produced when the pyro developer contains
too small a proportion of sulphite or is allowed to act for
a very long time. Such a stain is rarely observed with
the other developers mentioned above. The pyro stain
can be more or less completely removed by immersing
the plate for some time, with repeated rocking, in the
alum solution given above, 1 drachm of sulphuric acid
being added to every 10 ounces. The plate must afterwards
be well washed in soft water. Similar stains in
patches may be caused by using dirty dishes or a developer
that has become turbid by being frequently used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Deep Yellow-Orange or Brown Stains</span>, appearing
gradually in patches or all over the negative, some
time after it has been fixed, and washed, and dried, are
due either to imperfect fixing or to incomplete washing
after fixing. There is no practicable remedy.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0048" id="p0048">48</a></span>

<p><span class="smcap">Halation.</span>&mdash;When the subject photographed includes
some part much more brightly lighted than
the rest, such as a window in an interior subject, the
details of the bright part are not
only lost, but the image of it
seems to spread in all directions,
obliterating the details of the surrounding
portions. The effect is
especially noticeable when the
subject includes dark parts which
necessitate a somewhat long exposure.
A window at the end of
a long dimly lighted interior, or
dark trees against a bright sky
are cases in point. The effect is
really due to the fact that the
sensitive film is not perfectly
opaque, and some of the incident
light passes through the film and
is reflected from the back surface
of the glass on to the under side
of the film, producing a blurred
image superposed, as it were, on
the normal image formed at the
surface of the film by the action of
the direct light. The effect is
known as "halation." It is prevented
by having a perfectly
opaque film, which is a condition
difficult to realize in practice, and
which, moreover, introduces certain
other disadvantages. It is
also prevented by coating the back
of the plate with some substance
that will absorb the rays that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0049" id="p0049">49</a></span>
passed through the film, and so prevent their being
reflected back against the under side of the film. The
substance used must either be opaque or must have a
deep orange, brown, or red colour, and it must have the
same refractive index as the glass, otherwise the reflection
will not be prevented. For practical convenience it
must also be easily applied and easily removed. Many
substances have been recommended but nothing is so
good as caramel, prepared by the action of heat on sugar.
In order to get the mixture to dry completely after it
has been applied, a somewhat troublesome process of
purification is necessary, but caramel specially prepared
for the purpose can now be obtained from dealers in
photographic materials. The caramel (which is a solid
substance) is dissolved in just enough water to make a
thick syrup, which is carefully applied to the back of the
plates in a thin layer by means of a flat brush.</p>

<p>If the caramel does not dry properly the solution
may be thoroughly mixed with about one quarter (or
more) of its weight of very finely powdered burnt sienna
or burnt umber, "ground in water."</p>

<p>After being coated, the plates require some time to
dry, and must, of course, be carefully protected from
light. If the dark-room is thoroughly dark, the plates
may be put up to dry in the same manner as negatives
(see <a href="#p0040">page 40</a>), but if the dark-room is not suitable, some
sort of drying box must be used.</p>

<p>After exposure and before development the backing
is removed with a damp sponge; if caramel only is used
in a form completely soluble in water, it need not be
removed unless a developer is being used that is to be
applied to several plates in succession.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">REDUCTION.</p>

<p>When a negative is too opaque or dense it must be
reduced by dissolving away part of the silver that forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0050" id="p0050">50</a></span>
the image. The same process is also applied for the
removal of general fog, sometimes with a view to
subsequent intensification.</p>

<p>The simplest solution to use for this purpose is
known as the Howard Farmer reducer and is a solution
of hypo mixed with a small quantity of potassium
ferricyanide (red prussiate of potash).</p>

<p>The negative which, if it has been previously dried,
must be soaked in water for some time until it is
thoroughly and uniformly wetted, is placed in some
fresh hypo solution (the ordinary fixing-bath solution
diluted with an equal volume of water) to which a small
quantity of the ferricyanide solution has been added, and
the dish is rocked repeatedly to ensure uniform action.
The rapidity of the reducing action depends on the
proportion of ferricyanide solution added, and it is very
important not to add too much, otherwise the process
gets out of control and reduction goes too far. The
image should be carefully watched and the plate
removed from the solution and rapidly washed before
the apparent reduction is quite as great as it is intended
to be. It is much better to stop too soon than too late,
because if it is found that a little further reduction is
necessary, the plate can be again immersed in the hypo
and ferricyanide.</p>

<p>The ferricyanide reducer can be applied locally for
reducing high-lights, halated windows, etc., and this is
often very valuable, especially in the case of under-exposed
negatives. A small quantity of hypo and
ferricyanide solution is mixed in a measuring glass or
some other suitable vessel. The plate is immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0051" id="p0051">51</a></span>
plain hypo solution in a white dish for a short time and
is then raised by one corner or one edge until the part
to be reduced is above the solution. The mixture of
hypo and ferricyanide is carefully applied with a camel's
hair brush to the parts that are too opaque, and after a
few moments the plate is allowed to slip back into the
hypo solution and the dish is rocked. If the reduction
is not sufficient, the same proceeding is gone through as
often as necessary. The reducer should not be allowed
to act too long before putting the plate back into
the hypo, otherwise the reduction may spread further
than is desired. Further, the reducer must not be too
strong (<i>i.e.</i>, contain too much ferricyanide), otherwise it
will produce brownish stains and the action may be too
energetic.</p>

<p>The other reducer is known as Belitzski's reducer,
and is made up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<br />
<p class="center">INTENSIFICATION.</p>

<p>Intensification is a process in which the opacity of
the image is increased by adding some fresh matter,
metallic or otherwise, to the reduced silver that
constitutes the developed image.</p>

<p>The usual plan is to bleach the image by means of
a solution of mercuric chloride (mercury perchloride or<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0052" id="p0052">52</a></span>
corrosive sublimate), which converts the dark-coloured
silver into a white mixture of silver chloride and
mercurous chloride, and this is subsequently treated
with some re-agent which will reconvert the image into a
dark product of greater opacity than the original.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential to successful intensification
that the negative be completely fixed and completely
washed after fixing, for any trace of hypo left in the
film will give rise to brown stains. It is also important,
in order to prevent stains of another sort and to secure
uniform action, that the mercuric chloride solution be
mixed with a small quantity of hydrochloric acid. Too
much acid will cause frilling. If the negative has been
dried it must be immersed in water for, as a rule, not
less than half-an-hour, in order that it may be thoroughly
and uniformly wetted.</p>

<p>When uniform intensification is required the negative is
allowed to remain in this solution until it is completely
bleached. If, however, it is desired to intensify the
shadows more than the high-lights, the plate should be
removed from the solution as soon as the shadows have
bleached, and should be rapidly washed in order to stop
the action on the more opaque parts of the image.</p>

<p>In either case the negative must be thoroughly
washed after bleaching, and the water used must be
soft water. Hard water tends to produce a precipitate
of the mercury salt in the film, which may subsequently
lead to stain or fog.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best plan of all, when constant results
are desired, is to treat the bleached negative with the
ferrous oxalate developer, which will gradually convert
the white image into a black one, after which the plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0053" id="p0053">53</a></span>
is thoroughly washed and dried. It is recommended
that the first water used for washing should be slightly
acidified with oxalic acid.</p>

<p>Instead of using ferrous oxalate the bleached plate
may be treated with a weak solution of ortol or metol
to which some sodium carbonate (soda crystals) solution
has been added, but <i>no sulphite</i>. After the image has
blackened completely the plate is washed.</p>

<p>With any of these methods if the first intensification
is not sufficient, the plate may be again bleached
with the mercury solution and the process repeated.</p>

<p>An old method, frequently used, is to treat the
bleached plate with dilute ammonia, which converts the
white image into a dark brown one of very considerable
printing opacity. The results are often very good, but
are somewhat uncertain, since the precise effect obtained
depends on the strength of the ammonia solution and
the time during which it is allowed to act. With
somewhat strong ammonia, allowed to act for a fairly
long time, part of the intensification first produced is
removed. This affects the shadows more strongly than
the lights and the result is to increase the contrast of
the negative, which is very useful for certain purposes.</p>

<p>The negatives intensified with mercury solution
followed by ammonia are more liable to spontaneous
change and deterioration than those intensified with
mercury solution followed by one of the developers.
The latter, in fact, if properly washed, may safely be
regarded as permanent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Uranium Intensifier.</span>&mdash;A very considerable
degree of intensification can be obtained by the use of
the uranium intensifier, which is very different in its
mode of action, and is a little uncertain in its results.
A solution containing potassium ferricyanide and a
uranium salt, generally the nitrate, is applied to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0054" id="p0054">54</a></span>
negative, and a deposit of a deep orange-red colour is
formed upon the silver image and very greatly increases
its printing opacity. The great difficulty is to prevent
this deposit forming on the whole of the film, and it is
absolutely necessary that every trace of hypo should be
washed out of the film. The addition of acetic acid to
the solution not only promotes uniformity of action, but
also helps to keep the shadows of the image clear.</p>

<p>The negative is placed in this solution and allowed
to remain with occasional rocking until the degree of
intensification is sufficient, which can only be learnt by
experience. If it is seen that the deposit is beginning
to form on the clear parts of the negative, the plate
should be at once removed. After intensification the
plates are well washed. If the water is "hard" the
intensification will be slightly reduced during washing,
and this is often useful in removing a slight stain
over the whole of the plate. Treatment with water
containing a small quantity of ammonia or sodium
carbonate removes the whole of the deposit, but leaves
the original image slightly reduced and also partially
altered in composition.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">VARNISHING.</p>

<p>A negative after been thoroughly dried may be used
for printing without any further treatment, especially if
only a few prints are required and the ordinary ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0055" id="p0055">55</a></span>
sensitized papers or emulsion papers are used. It is,
however, better to protect the negative from mechanical
as well as chemical injury by means of a film of hard
varnish or collodion.</p>

<p>Many excellent negative varnishes can now be
purchased, and the general mode of application is the
same. The negative must be thoroughly dry, and in
order to secure this and to make the varnish flow more
easily, the negative is very carefully heated in front of
a fire or over a small stove until it is just warm, but not
hot. The negative is best supported by means
of a pneumatic holder held in the left hand, and
a fairly large pool of varnish (the exact amount
can only be learnt by experience) is poured on the
plate somewhat towards the right-hand top corner,
and by carefully tilting the plate it is made to run first
to the nearest corner, then along the edge to the further
left-hand corner down to the nearer left-hand corner,
and back to the right-hand bottom corner, from which
it is poured into a bottle. The plate is gently rocked
whilst it drains into the bottle, and as soon as the varnish
ceases to drop the plate is again carefully warmed until
the back of it is just too hot for the back of the hand to
bear, after which it is placed in a rack to cool.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the varnish should be quite
clear and free from any solid particles, and if necessary
it must be filtered through a plug of cotton wool
moistened with alcohol and placed in the apex of a glass
funnel which is resting in the neck of a clean and dry
bottle. Since dust may fall into the varnish whilst it is
on the negative, it is the best plan to pour the excess of
varnish off the negative into a second bottle instead of
back into the first, out of which it was poured. To put
it in another way, one bottle should be kept for the clear
varnish, and a second bottle for the varnish poured off<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0056" id="p0056">56</a></span>
the plate. When the second bottle is full, its contents
are filtered into the first bottle for use again.</p>

<p>Instead of varnish, a film of collodion, toughened
by the addition of a few drops of castor oil, and known
as "leather" collodion, may be used. The collodion is
applied to the plate in the same way as varnish except
that the plate is not warmed.</p>

<p>Photographs of
flat objects such
as leaves, lace, drawings,
etc., can be made by
simply putting the object
on the sensitive surface
and exposing the arrangement
to light. But this
method will not serve if
the photograph is wanted
of any other size than
the original, nor with
solid objects of any size,
except perhaps in the production
of full-size profiles
of faces. It is therefore
quite the exception in
photography to "print"
directly from the object itself,
and the only alternative
is to produce an image
on the sensitive surface.</p>

<p>All illuminated objects reflect light and so become
for practical purposes sources of light, just as the moon
shines, as we say, although it only shines because it is
shone upon by the sun. The simplest source of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0058" id="p0058">58</a></span>
to consider is a point of light, and if we can get a dot of
light on a white surface from a point of light we have at
once an image of that point of light. The smaller the
dot the sharper or more perfect is the image, the larger
the dot the more diffused or fuzzy is the image. It is
impossible by any known means to get the dot so small
that it is an actual point, that would be absolute perfection,
and on the other hand there is no size of the dot
at which it can be definitely said that it ceases to be an
image. Every point of an illuminated object is a point
of light, and fine definition consists in keeping these points
separate in the image. So far as the dots overlap they
are confused. Confusion, or diffusion, or fuzziness is
sometimes desirable, as for example in a portrait, which
may be excellent although it is impossible to distinguish
in the picture the individual hairs on the person's head.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 1.">

	<span class="figcap"><i>Fig. 1.</i></span>
</div>

<p>The simplest means for getting an image is a small
hole in an opaque screen. In fig. 1, two points of light,
A and B, shine through the hole in the screen S and
produce two dots of light, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, on the surface T.
The two pencils of light do not practically interfere with
each other although they pass through the same small
hole, nor would any greater number; so that an illuminated
object, which may be regarded as consisting of an
infinite number of points of light, would give an image
on the surface T. The disadvantages of a small hole,
or "pinhole," for the production of images are (1) it<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0059" id="p0059">59</a></span>
must be so small that it lets very little light through and
therefore gives a very feeble image, (2) that it can never
give a sharp image. The first disadvantage is obvious.
With regard to the second, a little consideration will
show that the image of a point must be larger than the
hole itself, it is always larger though it may have a
central brighter part that is smaller. If the hole is
reduced in size beyond a certain limit, it gives an
increased spreading of light on the surface, so that a
sharp image can never be produced.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 2." >
	<a name="cp0059" id="cp0059" ></a>

		<br />
		<span class="figcap"><i>Fig. 2.</i></span>
</div>

<p>Now the function of a lens is to obviate these drawbacks
as far as possible; namely, to let more light
through and form a brighter image, and to give sharper
definition. In figure 2, the lens L collects all the light
that falls upon it from the point B, and condenses it to
the point <i>b</i> on the surface T. The light from the point
A that falls on the lens is also condensed and would be
brought to a point or "focus" at <i>a</i> beyond the surface T,
but on the surface the light forms a patch of considerable
size. Suppose that the lens is thirty times the
diameter of the pinhole its area is 900 times as large,
and the light that falls upon it is 900 times as much as
the light that passes through the hole. Such an
enormous gain of light is worth so much that photographers
willingly put up with the very many imperfections
of lenses for the sake of it, and if to this gain
there is added the superior definition that is possible,
it will be seen that lenses are indispensable to the
photographer. To take a Daguerreotype portrait with<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0060" id="p0060">60</a></span>
a pinhole might have required several days if not weeks
exposure of the plate and therefore would have been
impossible, so that the gain in brightness of image is a
great deal more than a mere convenience.</p>

<p>It will be observed in figure 1 that both points of
light, A and B produce images on the surface T,
although they are at different distances from it, but in
fig. 2, although the effect of the lens is to concentrate
the light from both points to two other points, one of
these is beyond the surface T. This is a disadvantage
inherent in lenses. They have so many other imperfections
or "aberrations" that it is desirable to consider
these separately. The reader should bear in mind that
the one aim of opticians in perfecting lenses is to concentrate
as much light as possible from each point in
the object to a corresponding point, or as small as
possible a dot, in the image, and the image should be
flat because the plates used in photography are flat.</p>

		<span class="figcap"><i>Fig. 3.</i></span>
</div>

<p><i>Spherical Aberration.</i>&mdash;The surfaces of lenses are
always ground to spherical curves, and this fact makes
it impossible for a single lens, such as that shown in
figure 2, to bring to a point all the light that falls upon
it from a point. If a pencil of light passes through a
piece of glass with sloping sides it is bent or "refracted"
towards the thicker part of the glass, and the greater
the angle of inclination of the two sides the more is it
refracted from its original path. In figure 3 it is clear
that the two sides of the lens shown in section are
inclined to each other at a continually increasing angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0061" id="p0061">61</a></span>
as they approach each other at the edges of the lens.
The refracting effect of the lens increases from the
centre outwards, and it increases to a greater extent
than is necessary to bring the incident light to a point.
The focus of the pencils of light that pass through the
edges of the lens is nearer to the lens than the focus of
the pencils that pass through its central part. In the
figure two foci are shown, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, but of course, in fact,
intermediate parts of the lens produce intermediate foci,
and what should be a point in the image, is spread out
into a line on the axis of the lens, and all along this line
is surrounded with the light that either is coming to
a focus or that has come to a focus and has spread out
again. On a screen placed at <i>b</i> there would be a point
of light surrounded by a halo, while at <i>a</i>, nearer the
lens, the central focus or point is surrounded by a
brighter or more condensed light, and the appearance is
of a circular patch of light with a brighter boundary.
This is positive spherical aberration. Negative
spherical aberration is due to over correction, the focus
of the light passing through the margins being furthest
from the lens, and the appearances on a screen are of
course reversed.</p>

<p><i>Chromatic Aberration.</i>&mdash;When light is refracted, that
is bent out of its original path by a single piece of glass,
it is not refracted as a whole, but each constituent
behaves as if none other were present. Ordinary white
light or daylight is a mixture of many coloured lights as
seen in the rainbow, and when refracted, the blue is
bent more than the green, the green more than the
yellow, and the yellow more than the red. So that
using a single lens the focus of the blue light is nearer
the lens than the focus of the red light and the others
come in between. In figure 4 this is represented in an
exaggerated degree to make it more distinct. It will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0062" id="p0062">62</a></span>
observed that a screen placed at the focus of the blue
light will show a reddish margin and if removed further
from the lens the margin or halo will be bluish.</p>

<p>These two aberrations, spherical and chromatic <i>were</i>
the principal faults that opticians had to deal with,
because they affect the whole of the image, even the
very central parts. But in photography it is necessary
to get an image of a very large size as compared with
the focal length of the lens, and there are some faults
that only begin to show themselves at a little distance
from the centre of the image and increase as the distance
from the centre is greater. These aberrations were,
practically speaking, incurable until a few years ago, but
as recent optical advances have provided kinds of glass
by the use of which they may be eliminated, or nearly
so, they have become of practical importance. They
are astigmatism and curvature of field.</p>

<p><i>Astigmatism and Curvature of Field.</i>&mdash;If a diagram of
suitable size is made with a series of concentric circles
and radial lines upon it, and the centre of it is arranged
exactly opposite the centre of the lens, and in a line with
the centre of the focussing screen, the screen and diagram
being parallel, then if the lens suffers from astigmatism
it will be found impossible to get the outer circles and
the radial lines where they cross them simultaneously
focussed. Where this difficulty begins the astigmatism
begins, and the greater the difference there is between
the focal planes of the radial lines and the circles, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0063" id="p0063">63</a></span>
greater is the astigmatism. It will probably be found
with any of the older types of lenses that neither is in
focus at the same time that the centre of the diagram is,
but that the screen must be racked in; this is due to
curvature of field, and the difference between the curvature
of field for the circles and the radial lines is due to
astigmatism. In the older lenses a flatter field could
only be obtained by the introduction of astigmatism, but
now by the employment of the new glasses made at
Jena, it is possible to practically eliminate astigmatism,
and still keep the field flat.</p>

<p><i>The Development of Photographic Lenses.</i>&mdash;When photography
was first practised the best lenses available were
those made for use as telescope objectives, and they had
to be used with a small diaphragm to get good definition
over a sufficient field. With the slow processes
then in vogue a more rapid lens was much desired, and
Voigtlander introduced a "portrait" lens constructed
according to the results of the calculations of Professor
Petzval. This portrait lens is still very largely used,
and figure 5 will serve to show its general character
and will be a guide to the putting of one together
correctly if it has been taken to pieces for cleaning. A
rapid lens such as this could not cover a sufficiently large
field for landscape work, so that single lenses were still
used for work in which rapidity was not of very great
importance. Single lenses were improved, and other
kinds of lenses were introduced from time to time, but it<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0064" id="p0064">64</a></span>
was not till 1866 that the "rapid rectilinears" or "rapid
aplanats," called later "rapid symmetricals," and by
innumerable other names according to the fancies of the
makers, were introduced. Probably no lens has been
made in such large numbers as this.</p>

<p>At about the same time, Dallmeyer introduced his
portrait lens in which the position of the convex and
concave elements of the back combination is reversed,
the concave lens being outside, and this gives the photographer
the opportunity of screwing it back a little, and
so introducing a measurable amount of spherical aberration
which has the effect of modifying the otherwise
exceedingly fine definition at the centre of the field, and
giving a greater depth of definition.</p>

<p>In 1881, Messrs. Abbe &amp; Schott began a series of
experiments in the manufacture of optical glasses, and
they were so successful in making new and useful
varieties, that an optical glass factory was eventually
established at Jena, by Schott &amp; Co. By the use of
these newer glasses the limitations that had previously
restricted opticians were removed, and it became possible
to correct astigmatism and secure a flat field at the same
time. Zeiss of Jena, towards the end of 1890, introduced
his first series of "anastigmats." The "concentric"
lens of Ross was introduced in 1892, a lens which
probably remains unsurpassed for flatness of field and
freedom from astigmatism; but as spherical aberration
is present to a notable degree, an aperture of about <i>f</i>/22
is the largest that gives sharp definition. The "double
anastigmat" of Goerz of Berlin was put on the market
in 1893. It is a symmetrical lens, and in this different from
the Zeiss anastigmats that preceded it. It consists of
two similar combinations, each of three lenses cemented
together. The unsurpassed qualities of this lens stimulated
other opticians to seek to rival it, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0065" id="p0065">65</a></span>
appeared similar lenses with four and even five lenses in
each combination, besides other lenses that are more or
less a copy of the double anastigmat. One of the most
notable of these is the "satz-anastigmat" of Zeiss, each
combination consisting of four lenses cemented together
and forming an excellent single lens. These combinations
are interchangeable in the same mount so that
with, for example, one mount and three lenses, six
different focal lengths can be obtained, as the lenses
may be used singly or any two together as a doublet.</p>

<p>The "Cooke" lens is remarkable for the simple
means by which the various corrections are made,
consisting as it does of only three single lenses separated
from each other. Obviously it must be used entire.
These lenses do not cover so large a plate in proportion to
their focal lengths as most of the other anastigmats, but
perform excellently over the plates for which they are
constructed.</p>

<p>The "stigmatic" of Dallmeyer is the latest lens
of general utility. It gives good definition to the
margin of the circle of light that it transmits, reduction
of aperture being necessary, when its full field is
employed, to get equality of illumination rather than to
improve the marginal definition. Its two combinations
are different, and either may be used alone as a single
lens, giving focal lengths of approximately one-and-a-half
and twice the focal length of the whole lens.</p>

<p>The "planar" of Zeiss introduced just as we write,
is a symmetrical doublet characterized by a very large
aperture, from <i>f</i>/3.6 to <i>f</i>/4 up to 10 inches in focal length,
and a little smaller above that. It is therefore comparable
with portrait lenses. Although it is symmetrical, a
single combination cannot with advantage be used
alone as a single lens. Telephotographic lenses are
subsequently referred to.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0066" id="p0066">66</a></span>

<p>The one aim of opticians in improving photographic
lenses has been to get good definition all over a comparatively
large flat surface without having to use small
apertures. A defining power on the axis of the lens,
that is, at the centre of the field, far exceeding what can
be taken practical advantage of in ordinary photography,
has long been possible. But until recently, the defining
power always rapidly deteriorated as the distance from
the centre was increased. But to judge of the quality
of a lens, or to compare one lens with another, there are
other matters that must be understood, and these we
shall proceed to consider. Focal length, aperture and
image angle are the chief details concerning lenses,
granting that the aberrations referred to above are
satisfactorily corrected.</p>

<p><i>Focal length.</i>&mdash;The focal length or focal distance of
a thin lens is the distance between it and the point to
which it converges parallel rays. The rays of light are
parallel when they issue from an object at an infinite
distance. For ordinary practical purposes, any object,
that is not nearer than a thousand focal lengths of the
lens may be regarded as at an infinite distance, that is
the image of an object so far off, and the image of the sun
or stars (which are situated at the nearest approach to an
infinitely great distance that we know of) would if separately
focussed give an inappreciably small difference of
position of the focussing screen. But no photographic
lens is very thin. The measurement from the back
surface of the lens to the screen, when focussed on a
distant object, is called the "back focus," but this is of
no use whatever except as to the determining of the
camera length necessary. The "equivalent focal length"
is the focal length (or focal distance) of a thin lens that
would give the same effect, so far as focal length is
concerned, as the lens in question. When the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0067" id="p0067">67</a></span>
expression "focal length" is used, it always refers to the
equivalent focal length. The single word "focus"
is sometimes used erroneously instead of "focal
length."</p>

<p>The focal length of all lenses (except to a very small
extent, with single or so-called "landscape" lenses) is proportional
to the linear dimension of the image that it gives
under similar conditions. For example, a lens of 6
inches focal length will give just the same amount of
subject on a quarter plate that a lens of 12 inches focal
length will give on a whole plate, because the linear
measurement of the whole plate is exactly double that
of the quarter plate. The easiest way to compare the
focal lengths of two lenses, is to focus both on a fairly
distant object or view, and to measure in the image the
distance between two fixed points in both cases. The
proportion between these measurements is the proportion
between the focal lengths of the lenses. By this method
the focal length of any lens can easily be determined
if one has a lens of known focal length.</p>

<p>If a lens is first focussed on a distant object, and
the focussing screen is then moved back until the image
of any object is of the same size as the object, the
distance travelled by the focussing screen is exactly the
focal length of the lens. It is however exceedingly
difficult to get at the same time an image of an exactly
predetermined size, and to secure the very best definition,
so that it is more convenient to get the image as near as
it happens to come to the size of the object and then to
allow for the difference, as then nothing interferes with
the operation of focussing. The best near object to
use is an accurately divided scale, and the details
wanted in addition to those mentioned above are the
comparative lengths of the image and the object. To
get these, two fine marks are made on the focussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0068" id="p0068">68</a></span>
screen, and the distance between these is the length of
the image. The scale is focussed with critical exactness
and so that it falls over these marks, then the
amount of the scale represented between the marks can
be measured, and the divisions counted for the length of
the object. The distance over which the focussing
screen was moved between the two focussings is
to be multiplied by the length of the object and divided
by the length of the image, and the result is the focal
length of the lens.</p>

<p><i>Aperture.</i>&mdash;The "aperture" of a lens is the diameter
of the cylinder of light that it can receive and transmit.
If the diaphragm is in front of the lens, the hole in
the diaphragm is the aperture, but if the diaphragm
is behind a part of the lens, so that the incident light
passes through a lens first, the hole in the diaphragm
is not the "aperture," the "aperture" is larger because
the lens condenses the light before it gets to the
diaphragm. The aperture of any lens can be measured
by focussing a distant object, then replacing the focussing
screen by a sheet of cardboard with a pinhole in the
middle of it. In a dark-room a light must be placed
behind the pinhole, and a bit of ground glass held
in front of the lens. A disc of light will be seen
on the ground glass and the diameter of this is the
diameter of the aperture, or simply, the "aperture,"
with the diaphragm employed.</p>

<p><i>Rapidity.</i>&mdash;The rapidity of a lens depends almost
wholly on its focal length and aperture. The thickness
of the glass makes a little difference, and at every surface
in contact with air there is loss by reflection, but these
and analogous matters are of comparatively little importance,
and as they are uncertain and cannot be determined
it is customary to refer rapidity to the focal length and
aperture only. The aperture found, that is, the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0069" id="p0069">69</a></span>
of the effective incident cylinder of parallel rays, should
be divided into the focal length, and the diaphragm
corresponding to the aperture should then be marked
with a fractional expression indicating the proportion of
aperture to focal length. Thus if the aperture is one
eighth the focal length, it is marked <i>f</i>/8, if a sixteenth
<i>f</i>/16, and so on. All lenses with the same aperture as so
marked may be regarded as of equal rapidity whatever
their focal lengths may be. Now the more rapid a lens
is the shorter the exposure that it is necessary to give
for any subject, and the exposure required is proportional
to the square of the figure in the expressions as given
above. Namely 8 and 16 squared give 64 and 256 which
are as one to four, the proportional exposures required.
Or we may say that 8 to 16 are as 1 to 2 and square
these and get 1 to 4 the proportional exposures.</p>

</div>

<p>The best way to mark stops is, for example, <i>f</i>/8 and
<i>f</i>/16, as these expressions are universally understood, but
some persons think that the relative rapidities or
intensities are better, others prefer to express the relative
exposure necessary, and every system of numbering on
these plans has a unit which is merely empirical, not one
of them adopting the only true or scientific unit of <i>f</i>/1.</p>

<p>Zeiss has recently changed his unit from <i>f</i>/100 to <i>f</i>/50.
Dallmeyer marks some of his lenses now with the practical
expression. The following table may be of service to
those who happen to have lenses with their diaphragms
marked on any of these empirical systems.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0070" id="p0070">70</a></span>

<p><i>Image Angle.</i>&mdash;The image angle represents what is
called covering power. It may be expressed in terms of
the focal length, and doubtless this is the best method, but
it is not customary. It may be expressed as an angle,
the angle formed when a line is drawn from each
extremity of a line equal to the diameter of the circle
covered, and caused to meet at a point distant from the
base line equal to the focal length of the lens. The
angle where the two lines meet is the image angle. But
generally the covering power is expressed more roughly,
as the ordinary size of the plate that sufficiently good
definition can be obtained on.</p>

<p><i>Tele-Photographic Lenses.</i>&mdash;If a negative (or dispersing
or concave) lens is introduced between the
ordinary lens and the plate, the equivalent focal length
of the arrangement is greater than that of the ordinary
lens alone, but the length of camera necessary is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0071" id="p0071">71</a></span>
proportionately great. It is possible therefore to obtain
an image of a size that would otherwise require a lens
of long focal length and a corresponding and perhaps
impossible length of camera. But this is not the only
advantage, for if the ordinary lens and the negative lens
are separable to a variable extent, the amount of
magnification of the image, or increase in the equivalent
focal length of the optical system, is adjustable at will.
For further details concerning tele-photographic lenses
and their use, reference should be made to Mr. Dallmeyer's
pamphlet on the subject.</p>

<p>There are two other subjects connected with the
production of images by photographic lenses that must
be referred to, though neither of them is of great
importance if we exclude the use of hand cameras
(which are separately treated of) and bear in mind the
ordinary practice of to-day. These are depth of definition
and the distortion due to the use of single lenses.</p>

<p><i>Depth of Definition.</i>&mdash;It has already been shown that
the action of the lens is to bring to a point in the image
all the light that falls upon it from the corresponding
point of the object. Now it is clear from fig. 2 that,
if different parts of the object are at different distances
from the lens, and this must be the case with solid
objects, these different parts cannot be in focus
at the same time. Still it is possible to get them so
nearly in focus that the result is serviceable, and the
ordinary method of doing this is to examine the image
on the ground glass, and if the whole subject is not
sharp enough, to reduce the size of the aperture. Depth
of definition is increased by using a lens of shorter focal
length or by reducing the aperture. If a large aperture
has to be used, the focal length must be short if much
depth of definition is wanted, or conversely, if the focal
length must be long the aperture must be small. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0072" id="p0072">72</a></span>
follows that very rapid lenses that have a very long
focus are of no use, for in portraiture, for example, this
combination of properties would lead to the ear in the
image being fuzzy if the eye was sharp.</p>

<p>If a lens were perfect and had a flat field, the depth
of definition would depend only on the aperture and
focal length. But if the lens gives inferior definition
towards the edges of the field, it is quite obvious that
there must be less depth of definition there, if a
minimum of defining power is accepted. The definition
at its best may be inferior to the minimum accepted and
then obviously there is no depth. Depth of definition
therefore at the centre of the plate depends entirely on
the focal length and aperture, but away from the centre
it depends also on the quality of the lens, and is much
greater in a flat field anastigmat than in a lens of an
older type. But depth of definition is not a quality
apart, it depends entirely upon other factors, and it is
better in examining a lens to determine these factors
separately rather than to lump them together as depth.</p>

<p><i>Distortion</i> produced by single lenses is due to the
fact that the diaphragm is either in front of or behind them.
If the diaphragm is in front, the image is drawn towards
the centre of the plate to an extent that increases as the
margin of the field is approached. A line along one side
of the plate has its ends drawn in to a greater amount
than its centre, because they are further from the middle
of the plate, and therefore it becomes curved like the
side of a barrel, and this effect is called barrel-shaped
distortion. If the diaphragm is behind the lens, the
displacement is outwards, also increasing towards the
edges of the field, and a straight line at the edge of the
plate becomes curved so that it is convex towards the
centre of the plate. This is known as hour-glass distortion.
Both these effects are illustrated (and exaggerated<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0073" id="p0073">73</a></span>
for clearness' sake) in fig. 6, the central square representing
the true figure. This "curvilinear distortion" is
absent in all cases in the middle of the plate and generally
for a considerable area, and if single lenses of only
long focal length are used, say of a focal length equal to
at least one and a half times the length of the largest side
of the plate, it may be neglected. Wide-angle single
lenses should never be used except on a suitably small
plate, so that the above conditions hold. The nearer
the diaphragm is to the lens the less is the distortion,
and some of the most modern single lenses have the
diaphragm so near that the photographer is even more
safe in the use of them.</p>

<p><i>The Comparison and Use of Lenses.</i>&mdash;The optician
when he tests lenses looks for each fault individually,
but this the ordinary photographer is hardly able to do,
nor is it particularly desirable for him, because if a lens
is inferior it matters little to him why it is so. On the
other hand occasion may arise when he wants to identify
a fault, then the information already given will probably
be sufficient to enable him to do so, if to it is added that
a small pinhole with a flame behind it is a convenient
point of light, and that if the image of this luminous
point is examined with a good eyepiece, without the
focussing screen, at various parts of the field, the
character of the defect may be discovered.</p>

<p>The main things that the photographer needs to
look to in judging of a lens or comparing it with another,
are (1) that it works to focus, (2) the quality of its
defining power especially towards the edges of the plate.
There must also be taken into account the focal length
and aperture, and if both these are not the same in the
lenses to be compared they should be nearly the same,
and the proportion that the aperture bears to the focal
length should be exactly the same. A special diaphragm<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0074" id="p0074">74</a></span>
may have to be cut out of card for one of them. The
best test object that is always at hand is a newspaper
pinned flat against a flat wall. The camera must not
be moved during the work. Each lens is very carefully
focussed and a negative made, using the same aperture,
time of development, and in all ways similar treatment
for both. If the focal lengths are different, the images
will be of correspondingly different sizes, and then the
same detail must be compared, not the definition at the
same distance from the centre.</p>

<p>All good lenses work to focus, but some of the
cheaper ones do not. To test this, any series of small
objects arranged side by side, but at distances varying
by intervals of say two inches from the camera, is photographed
after carefully focussing on the middle one. If any
other than the middle one is the best defined, the lens is
at fault. But in this, as in all similar tests, it must be
remembered that ordinary dry plates are not quite flat, and
the error of the plate may make an appreciable difference.</p>

<p>The use of lenses comprises the whole art of working
with the camera, it is therefore not our province to say
much about it. But so far as lenses themselves are
concerned it may be remarked that, if a lens has a round
field, it may be advantageous to tip up the lens with
regard to the plate when only a part of the plate is being
used, as for example sometimes in taking a landscape.
But in using the modern flat field lenses special care
should be taken to keep the lens and plate exactly true
to each other, the plate exactly at right angles to the
lens axis. The image and plate must coincide or definition
will suffer. If the image is rounded and the plate
flat, then in any case the result is only a compromise,
but to take full advantage of the larger apertures when
the field is flat, much more care than has been usual
must be devoted to this matter.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0075" id="p0075">75</a></span>

<p><i>Simple uncorrected lenses</i> such as <i>spectacle lenses</i> or
"<i>monocles</i>," suffer from the defects that have already been
described, and are valued on this account by some
workers because they give blurred or "soft" images.
With a small enough diaphragm they will give good
definition, and generally it may be stated that reducing
the aperture lessens the effect of any fault that a lens
may possess. To get the best definition that a simple
lens will give, the plate must be brought nearer the lens
after focussing by about one-fiftieth of the focal length
of the lens, so that it may be brought from the best focus
of visual light into the best focus of the photographically
active light. If the object photographed is nearer to the
lens than about one hundred times its focal length, the
amount of movement after focussing must be increased.
If four focal lengths distant, the correction is nearly
one-thirtieth of the focal length, at three focal lengths
distant, nearly one-twentieth, and at two focal lengths,
about a thirteenth.</p>

<p><i>Pinholes</i> give an image that for all practical purposes
may be said to be equally blurred or "soft" over the
whole plate. Much has been written about pinholes and
their use, but it is not definitely known yet whether the
exposure should be longer or shorter than the exposure
required when a lens is used, allowing, of course, for the
smallness of the aperture. The following short table
and exposure rules from the writer's "Science and
Practice of Photography," will probably prove useful:&mdash;</p>

at <i>f</i>/16, <i>f</i>/22, <i>f</i>/32, <i>f</i>/45, or <i>f</i>/64, as the case may be, and
multiply it by the <i>square</i> of the number of inches that the
plate is distant from the pinhole. But if the distance is
as given above for any hole, it is sufficient to expose for
as many minutes as the plate is inches distant from the
hole, for a subject that would require one second with
an aperture of <i>f</i>/16.</p>

<p>The photographer who
may be expert at
landscape or architectural
work, will find himself at
a loss when he essays
portraiture. For apart from
the art of managing the
sitter (a most important
element in producing a
successful result), he will
soon find that the kind of
plate that is suitable for
outdoor work does not
answer well for portraits,
unless the developer is
greatly modified, for quite
a different kind of negative
is required. As a general
rule it is advisable to use
very rapid plates for portrait
work; and in this
respect, at the present day
we are much better supplied than even five or six years
ago, and with an extra-rapid plate it is possible to secure a
fully exposed negative in half a second, in weather and
under lighting that was quite impossible ten years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0078" id="p0078">78</a></span>
The best expression and pose are generally secured
when the sitter is unaware of the actual moment of
exposure; and for this purpose a silent shutter working
inside the camera is best. The sitter should never be
<i>asked</i> to keep still unless, in groups, and when circumstances
necessitate a long exposure; and nowadays an
exposure of five or six seconds is a long one. Every
effort should be made to put the sitter quite at ease.</p>

<p>A head-rest should not be used unless absolutely
necessary, and few photographers are aware how easily
it can be dispensed with, and fail to realize how strong an
objection nearly every sitter has to it. It is far better to
have an occasional plate spoilt by working without the
rest than to make every sitter uncomfortable by its use.
In fact some portrait negatives are actually improved by
a slight movement. In a special kind of lighting when
the face is in <i>shadow</i> relieved against a light background,
a slight movement which produces the effect of diffusion
of focus greatly improves the result.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised in choosing the background
even when it is only plain or graduated, and it is
well worth exposing three or four plates on the same
sitter, in the same position and lighting, and with the same
exposure, but with different backgrounds, and then
carefully comparing the resulting prints. Even if only
one background is at hand its depth can be varied by
placing it nearer or farther from the source of light.
The background must also be selected to suit the
lighting of the sitter, as a background of medium tint
suitable for what is called "ordinary lighting" would be
quite unsuitable for "Rembrandt" effects, or where
strong contrasts of light and shade are used, when part
of the face is in dark shadow. For such effects a dark
background is usually best, as it gives luminosity to the
shadow side of the face. But such dark grounds are<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0079" id="p0079">79</a></span>
not suitable for "ordinary lighting" where the face
should be full of delicate half-tone, all of which would be
killed by the strength of the dark background.</p>

<p>For the Rembrandt effects a much longer exposure
is necessary as less light is reflected from the face on to
the sensitive plate; they will often need twice or three
times as much as for ordinary portraits.</p>

<p>When pictorial backgrounds or accessories are used
it must be remembered that the object of the photograph
is to secure a portrait of the <i>sitter</i>, not to show what a
large stock of accessories the photographer possesses. It
is best to use as few accessories as possible; I have
heard a lady complain bitterly of a well-known photographer,
who having posed her in a very difficult position,
kept her waiting for five minutes while he arranged a
screen, a palm, a footstool, a tiger-skin, etc., so that she
felt positively ill before the exposure was made. The
sitter should not be kept waiting in the pose to be photographed
any longer than is absolutely necessary. If
accessories must be used they should be simple and
suitable.</p>

<p>When portraits have to be taken in ordinary rooms
it is advisable to get a friend or assistant to experiment
upon, if possible beforehand. Even a few minutes spent
in studying the possibilities of light and arrangement of
furniture will save a great deal of worry when making
the actual exposures, and nothing upsets nervous
sitters more than having all kinds of experiments and
arrangements made with them. But it is sometimes
well worth wasting a few plates on exposures which the
photographer thinks will be useless, in order to give the
sitter time to get accustomed to the room; it must not be
done in a fussy, irritating way, but rather to show that
it is not such a very dreadful operation and really
"doesn't hurt." This plan often works well with<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0080" id="p0080">80</a></span>
nervous children, who soon become accustomed to the
room and the photographer. There is a great deal to be
said in favour of the maxim "leave your sitters alone."
The photographer must cultivate quick observation so
that he sees at once a good pose, and secures it; and
here again quick plates are essential, as many of the
most charming poses are caught unexpectedly. It has
been well said that the best poses the photographer
secures are those he <i>observes</i>, not those he <i>creates</i>. But a
spontaneous pose may not be quite perfect and a slight
alteration may be easily made without disturbing the
rest of the figure. It will generally be found that a pose
that takes a great deal of arranging is not a success.</p>

<p>When taking portraits in an ordinary room it is
usual to place the sitter near the window, so that one
side of the face is strongly lighted and the other in deep
shadow, and then use a white reflector to light up the
shadow side. It is often better, when the window is a
large one, to place the sitter farther back in the room
almost facing the window, and put the camera near the
middle of the window looking into the room; a softer
lighting will then be secured. For outdoor portraits a
shady corner is best, and if possible, one where the side
light is much subdued on one side; a light head-shade
may be used with advantage. A large grey rug out of
focus makes a good background; a blanket is too light.</p>

<p>A portrait lens is best for the work; but if the
photographer does not possess one, he need not despair
of producing good work. A rapid rectilinear lens used
at a large aperture will answer the purpose well; it
should always be used at full aperture, partly for the
sake of quickness in exposure, and partly to prevent
accessories and parts of the dress appearing too sharp
and competing in importance with the face. Subordination
of parts is one of the essentials of a picture; and if<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0081" id="p0081">81</a></span>
we examine a <i>good</i> portrait we shall find that probably
no part of the photograph is quite sharp except the eyes
and face. Otherwise the less important details are apt
to obtrude themselves on our notice. A stop will
generally be necessary, however, with a portrait lens if a
full or three-quarter length is to be taken, and it will be
found that heads only (as a rule) can be taken at
full aperture. Just as good work, however, can be done
with a rapid rectilinear as with a lens specially made for
portraits, except where rapid exposures are to be made;
but it is necessary to use one of fairly long focus. A
rapid rectilinear lens used for landscape work on a half
plate would be much too short in focus for giving good
portraits on the same sized plate, for in order to get the
figure large enough it is necessary to place the camera
so near the sitter as to produce distortion. For portraits
on a half plate a lens of at least nine inches focus should
be used and for a whole plate not less than sixteen or
eighteen inches, and longer if possible.</p>

<p>The swing back of the camera will be found useful
in portrait work for getting parts of the figures into
focus that are either too far behind or too far in front of
the plane of the face. For instance, a full-length figure
leaning back in a chair will have the feet out of focus
when the face is sharp if the back of the camera is
vertical, and this applies with even greater force to groups.
A side swing too is useful, but is not absolutely
necessary. Even in bust portraits the swing back is
useful in getting the shoulders in focus when using a
large aperture, for although it is well not to have the
whole of the figure in <i>perfect</i> focus all over, it is not
advisable to have the face sharp and the rest so out of
focus as to be blurred.</p>

<p>The development of a portrait plate should be
different from that of a landscape, because a different<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0082" id="p0082">82</a></span>
kind of negative is required. A rapid plate developed so
as to give a soft delicate image is best; and a developer
containing more alkali and less density giver is good, and
it may be considerably diluted with advantage. The
image should appear within ten seconds of pouring on
the developer, and the negative will generally be
developed to sufficient density in from two to three
minutes. With a good average rapid plate the image
should show fairly well on the back of the plate, but
this and the time of development will vary so much with
different developers, and with the taste of each photographer
that no hard and fast rule can be laid down.</p>

<p>Developers that give a brown deposit, or that stain
the film will require shorter development than those of
the newer developing agents that give a cold black
colour to the negative; another fact to be borne in mind is
that the image formed by these latter appears to lose
more density in fixing than when pyrogallic acid is used.</p>

<p>A perfect portrait negative should have no clear
glass shadows, and no part should be so dense as to give
white in the finished print, and some negatives which
give the best results may have a decided veiled appearance
in the shadows.</p>

<p>The temperature of the developer is another
important point; in very cold weather the developer
should be kept warm, or if in concentrated solutions may
be diluted with warm water. In cases of known under-exposure
the developer may be used quite hot with
advantage. A convincing experiment can be made by
cutting an exposed plate in two and developing one half
with icy cold developer and the other half with warm. The
difference is really remarkable. If the developer has
been used hot enough to make the gelatine of the plate
feel "slimy" an alum bath is necessary, unless the
fixing bath contains chrome alum.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0083" id="p0083">83</a></span>

<p>The question of retouching is a difficult one. There
is no doubt that a certain amount of it is necessary on
nearly all portrait negatives and even on those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0084" id="p0084">84</a></span>
children. But it is equally certain that the great
majority of portrait negatives are over-retouched, so
much so that their value both as portraits and pictures is
nearly destroyed. Yet a certain amount is necessary
even for pictorial effect, and perhaps still more when the
question of likeness is considered. For as a rule the
untouched negative is no more a true likeness than the
over-retouched one. The truth lies somewhere between
the two. Even if isochromatic plates are used the little
differences of colour in the face, and the incipient wrinkles
are exaggerated in an unpleasant way. Under-exposed
negatives will show these defects in a very marked
manner, full exposure will greatly reduce them. Large
heavy patches of shadow may be lightened by coating
the back of the negative with matt varnish, and when it
is quite hard "hatching" upon it with a soft lead.
Harsh lights may be reduced by scraping away the matt
varnish with the point of a knife. In some cases the
matt varnish may be stained with a little aurine or
uranine. Exaggerated lines and small shadows must be
worked upon from the front and a retouching desk is
necessary. The film of the negative will not take the
pencil without some preparation. The best surface is
obtained by spreading a little retouching medium with
the tip of the finger on the part to be touched. A thin
film of soft resin is left upon the plate which takes pencil
marks readily. A hard lead, No. 4 Faber or Hardtmuth,
should be used. The loose leads used in what are called
the "ever-pointed holders" are most convenient. The
point must be very long and fine, like a large darning
needle, and is best made by rubbing the lead on
a piece of fine glass-paper. The pencil must be
held very lightly and the lines touched away with
short <i>light</i> strokes, a heavy stroke only rubs the
medium up.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0085" id="p0085">85</a></span>

<p>The little shadow at the end of the mouth often has
to be reduced, often at the risk of spoiling the shape of
the lips, but sitters <i>will</i> insist upon it being done, and
say "You have made my mouth much too large."
Freckled faces are perhaps the most difficult to retouch,
as it is well nigh impossible to remove the black patches
caused by the freckles without at the same time
destroying the modelling of the face. Yet it must be
done, for probably the most severe stickler for truth
would not insist on the black blotches that freckles
produce in a photograph.</p>

<p>A great deal can be done to improve a hard negative
as soon as it leaves the fixing bath, by applying a mixture
of hypo solution and a solution of ferricyanide (not ferro)
of potash with a piece of cotton wool to the dense parts.
The proportions for this reducing bath are as follows:&mdash;To
each ounce of the ordinary hyposulphite of soda
fixing bath add a few drops of a 10% solution of ferricyanide
of potassium or red prussiate of potash, making
the whole about the colour of pale brandy. By adding
more of the ferricyanide solution the reducing action is
quicker, but there is a greater liability to stain the film.
The work should be done over a sink with a tap of
running water at hand. The solution should be of a
deep lemon colour (it is almost impossible to give exact
quantities), and after a short application must be
washed off under the tap, and the negative may then
be examined, and the reducer applied again and again
till the desired reduction is obtained. It is advisable
to make a few trials on spoilt plates. For if any
really good work is to be done there will be plenty
of rejected negatives. Probably, of all the plates exposed
on portraits by first-rate professional photographers,
not more than one-fourth ever get as far as the printing-frame.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0086" id="p0086">86</a></span>

<p>Moral: Do not be chary of exposing plates, they
are cheap enough now. Don't feel, "Oh! this will be
good enough. I won't do another." On the other hand
don't expose carelessly and recklessly and say, "It will
all come right in developing." Good work is not done
that way. Use every opportunity of seeing good work.
Study the work of great portrait painters, but don't
neglect the photographers. Go to all the exhibitions of
pictures and photographs within reach.</p>

<p>Don't be satisfied with what you have done, but
make a resolve to do something better next time.
Remember, what is worth doing at all is worth doing
well.</p>

<p>Unlike the subjects
of the other articles
in this book, in pictorial
photography we are not
brought to consider one of
the many processes which
go to make up the photographic
craft, but merely
a special and exceptional
application of any and all
means known to the photographer.</p>

<p>The particular end to
which this application is
made will be explained as
far as the limits of space
will permit, and some of
the methods of such application
will be described.
Beyond this I have no
intention of going. I do
not present pictorial photography
as a branch of photography especially worthy
of study&mdash;I am not concerned in making converts. It
is for the photographer who has already formed a desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0088" id="p0088">88</a></span>
to give his attention to the pictorial side of photography
and who is seeking help, that this chapter is designed.</p>

<p>First let us come to a mutual understanding as to
the term Pictorial Photography. Picture-making by
photography would perhaps be a simpler phrase, but
that to my mind the word "picture-making" is too
similar in idea to boot-making, lace-making, etc., all of
which imply a mechanical manufacturing, whereas a
picture&mdash;a real picture&mdash;like a musical composition, a
poem or a beautiful thought, grows or is evolved rather
than made to order.</p>

<p>Art photography would be a better term, but that
in photography the word "art" has been so often
coupled with things the very antithesis of artistic and
might hence be misleading, moreover the photographer
will show discretion rather than weakness if he be not
too hasty to claim for photography a position among the
arts, and whilst its claims to that dignity remain as yet in
dispute, we may be content with "Pictorial Photography"
as a less assuming title, yet one which will sufficiently
differentiate between what we may call the ordinary
photographic production and&mdash;&mdash; Well, what?</p>

<p>That is the first thing I have to try and explain.</p>

<p>Look at the illustrations in this book on pages 72,
136, and 120, and, making due allowance for some loss of
quality due to reproduction by a "half-tone" block, try
to imagine what the originals were like. Then say if
they please you. If you say no, you do not care for
them, they do not appeal to you, you do not mind if you
never saw anything of the kind again from this day
henceforth; very well, doubtless there are other things
in the world in which you can find pleasure, but so far
as my present subject is concerned, here you and I part
company. These illustrations are more or less successful
reproductions of pictorial work, and if you do not like<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0089" id="p0089">89</a></span>
them, making as I have said due allowance for their
being reproduced and reduced, then it is certain you do
not want to hear anything about them, and it is not my
intention to persuade you, so please pass on and make
room for those who do care for these things and wish to
learn all they can concerning them, or at most stand
aside and peradventure some stray word dropped unintentionally
may quicken your interest and discover in
you a sympathy of which you were previously unconscious.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Referring now again to the illustrations which in
the absence of anything else we take as fairly typical of
pictorial photographs and assuming that one or the other,
if not all, do please some of my readers, I will ask them
to endeavour to analyse their feelings when confronting
such productions.</p>

<p>Take now an ordinary commercial photographic view
such as one may purchase from any seaside stationer,
and compare the sensations awakened by each. In the
case of the topographical view we feel some satisfaction
at being able to recognise a familiar spot, or the view
reminds us of some other place, or it may be quaint
buildings, or rugged mountains, or miles of foliage, or
what not inspire curiosity or interest because we know
the photograph to be a true record of facts, that is to
say we accept the photograph in lieu of the actual
presence of the objects represented, and experience nearly
the same feelings as we should were we to visit the
spot represented. We know that the wonderful, curious,
or unusual things portrayed have an existence, otherwise
we could not have a photograph of them.</p>

<p>In all such cases our interest and value of the
photograph would vastly diminish, were it possible for a
photograph of this kind to be made simply by the photographer's
hand and imagination without any original at all.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0090" id="p0090">90</a></span>

<p>You look at a photograph of this or that sea-side
place and remark, "Ah, yes, that's dear old Yarmouth,
many a time, etc., etc.," or else, "Dear me, I wonder
what place that is, it's so like&mdash;&mdash;" such and such a
town, or it may be you enquire "Where's that?" and
you express or think to yourself you would like to go
and visit the spot. These and kindred sensations are
those kindled by the average photograph, but there is
yet another, for you may be impelled to exclaim, "How
wonderfully clear and bright that photograph is,"
"What a good photograph." In this case you are
interested purely in the execution as an example of clever
manipulation and skilful craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Now, compare such feelings as these with those
stirred by an example of good pictorial work. In the
first place your esteem for it, if you value it at all, is
quite as great whether you know the place where it was
made or not. If it pleases you, that pleasure is not
dependent upon the fact that it does represent some
place. In the case of paintings and drawings as often
as not they do not pretend to represent any place at all,
but are pure fiction, yet we do not value them the less.
To what then is the pleasure we feel when looking at a
good picture due? Is it not that a picture stirs up, that
is, <i>creates</i> pleasant or beautiful thoughts and ideas&mdash;by
pleasant I do not mean necessarily merry or joyous ones,
for some hearts feel profounder pleasure in the grandeur
of storm or the majesty of the mountain than in
the sweet wilderness of flowery wastes, but notice
that such beautiful ideas are <i>created</i> by the picture.
You were thinking of something totally different before
you came upon the landscape picture which instantly
made you feel the glowing light, the stirring breeze, and
hear the rustling corn and noisy brook, and yet it cannot
be said it is because we <i>recognise</i> these things in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0091" id="p0091">91</a></span>
picture that we receive these impressions, at least it is
not the kind of recognition which takes place when we
see a photograph of Brighton Pier or Haddon Hall.</p>

<p>Notice, it is not the exact and faithful portrayal of
objects that creates the emotions instanced, for if you
closely observe the manner in which a good painting is
done you will find that rude splashes of paint, broad
brush strokes, and the like stand for foliage or water, or
corn stalks as the case may be, when we know that had
the painter desired he <i>could</i> have produced his likeness of
nature with a good deal more of the precise detail and
fidelity to outlines which photography excels in, <i>had he
wished</i>. But if the painter or other pictorial artist needs
not to trouble about accuracy to details to secure the
effect aimed at he must be faithful to general facts.
There is a great difference between not recognising
things or having no particular wish to do so, and feeling
conscious that a portrayal is so utterly unlike anything
in our past experience of nature that we should not
recognise the objects even if we <i>were</i> acquainted with
them. To take an extreme case&mdash;our enjoyment of the
effect and sentiment of a beautiful landscape picture is
not enhanced by our being able to recognise whether the
trees are oaks or elms, but it would be distinctly disturbed
if the palm trees were represented as growing on
the slopes of a Welsh mountain. Innumerable examples
and instances might be given to show that the artist,
whatsoever his medium, be it colour or monochrome,
may depart from truth, or may be indifferent to precise
details, <i>only so far as he avoids palpable untruth</i>.</p>

<p>Why is this?</p>

<p>When we look at a powerful and impressive picture
we feel at once the sentiment, our emotions are at once
stirred, subsequently we recognise objects and facts
portrayed, but only when we begin to look for them or<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0092" id="p0092">92</a></span>
think about them; but a gross exaggeration or a very
obvious error strikes us at once before we begin to
receive sentiments and ideas, and that error or exaggeration
once seen is never lost sight of, and whole enjoyment
of the picture is hopelessly marred.</p>

<p>Now, from the foregoing (for want of space I am
aware that the argument is incomplete, and must therefore
ask the student to think the matter out and grasp
the side issues by reading between the lines) we may
formulate the broad definition that a picture does not
depend for its excellence on the faithful representation
of objects, and is not chiefly valuable on account of our
immediate recognition of things portrayed, yet on the
other hand it must not let us feel that there is obvious
inaccuracy.</p>

<p>Here then we have two opposite positions in both
of which the mere objects employed to build up the
picture are subordinated to the effect or impression of the
picture. In one case the spectator must not be allowed
to feel that the representation is <i>wrong</i>, in the other
success will not directly depend on the representation
being very <i>right</i>, neither startling rightness or truth nor
the obvious wrongness or untruth should thrust the
objects composing the picture upon the beholder's
attention, he should be left free to receive the expression
or sentiment of it.</p>

<p>I hope the reader is following me in this line of
thought closely. I am aware that it may seem dry and
uninteresting, but I see no other way of placing the
student in a proper position at the outset than by
explaining the essential elements of pictorial work, and
I will make this introductory part as brief as possible.</p>

<p>Reverting now to our argument, I have in other
words suggested that obvious violation of truth will
prevent the sentiment or effect of the picture from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0093" id="p0093">93</a></span>
paramount, and now I will submit that an excess of
accuracy to detail is equally detrimental to the success
of a picture as a picture.</p>

<p>If by now the reader is prepared to admit that the
chief purpose of a picture is the feelings, emotions, ideas
which it suggests or creates, and not the facts it portrays,
he will be able to go further and perceive that in a landscape,
for instance, cottages, trees, or what not are introduced,
not for their own intrinsic interest but as vehicles
of light and shade, which go to express the picture's
sentiments.</p>

<p>If we stand before a good picture with closed eyes
and suddenly open them, our first impression (precluding
any question of colour) is that of masses of light and
shade pleasingly and harmoniously arranged; if we retreat
to such a distance that the objects constituting those
lights and shades are unrecognisable the balance and
pleasing arrangement should still be felt, and our
æsthetic sense is satisfied, although we do not see fully
of what the picture is composed. This is the quality
which is termed breadth and which is admittedly of very
great value.</p>

<p>If on the other hand the shadow masses are filled
with innumerable details, and are thus broken up into
tiny lights and shadows they no longer exist as broad
masses of dark, but if before retreating as proposed from
the picture, the lights or shadows appear so blank as to
prompt particular investigation, and upon examination
we find detail absent which we know must have been
present, then we encounter an instance of untruth and
exaggeration which is obvious and which disturbs our
appreciation of other fine qualities. Thus we require
<i>sufficient detail to avoid giving the idea that detail is left out</i>.</p>

<p>The delineation of sharp outlines and redundance of
detail is not wrong in itself, but it is usually inexpedient<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0094" id="p0094">94</a></span>
when considered with respect to the effect to be produced,
similarly the suppression of sharp focus both as
regards outlines and details has no artistic merit of itself
except as it assists the picture to impress the beholder
first with the general effect.</p>

<p>The painter and photographer start from two
opposite standpoints. The painter, or draughtsman,
starts with nothing but blank paper, and having built up
his picture and produced his desired effect he elaborates
no further; the photographer with his more or less
mechanically produced <i>facsimile</i> starts from the opposite
extreme with a transcendentally elaborate image, from
which he will require to eliminate all such excess of
truth as is likely to force the mere facts of the view upon
the beholder's attention.</p>

<p>Photography, so faultlessly complete in its delineation,
gives us <i>more than the pictorial worker needs for
the expression of an idea</i>, and this is why I would
remind the student that pictorial photography is not
photography in the full sense of the word, but the
application of some of its powers, just as much as we
need and no more, to a definite end.</p>

<p>As just hinted the purpose of a picture is to express
ideas, hence I will fall back on a kind of definition
which I have used on a previous occasion that a picture
is the portrayal of visible concrete things for the expression
of abstract ideas.</p>

<p>To give an example by way of exposition we may
look upon a picture and be made to feel by it the calm
and luminous atmosphere of evening; we feel at once
the restfulness, and almost feel the warmth of the humid
air, giving place to the chill gathering mists of night;
but the same objects, the same tangible materials,
paper, pigment, metallic salts, etc., in another picture
give us the sense of angry turbulent storm or perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0095" id="p0095">95</a></span>
bright joyous sunshine frolicking with the fresh breezes
on the hill-tops. These are abstract ideas expressed or
created by the manner in which concrete things,
commonplace facts, are portrayed and rendered.</p>

<p>Finally, let me enunciate that a very excellent
photograph may not necessarily be a good picture,
because it may contain more than is required for the
expression of its idea, and the surplus will overwhelm
it; again, a good pictorial photograph may be but a poor
photograph, because if we claim the right to apply
photographic means to pictorial ends, we may find it
convenient to leave out the very qualities which the
scientific or technical expert considers most precious.</p>

<p>And now I think we may proceed to more practical
matters.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">COMPOSITION AND SELECTION.</p>

<p>In all matters from which the eye expects to derive
pleasure, symmetry of design seems essential. In the
formation of the letters that we write, in personal attire,
in the decoration of our homes, in buildings, and practically
in everything which is not of a purely utilitarian
character, a sense of proportion and a symmetrical disposition
of parts is observed. Hence it is no source of
surprise that in a picture which as much as anything
should aim at pleasing the eye, design, otherwise
Composition, is with Expression a co-essential.</p>

<p>In a purely decorative production this natural
desire of design is the only thing to be observed, but in
a picture which <i>may</i> be decorative, but <i>must</i> be something
more, we have expression as well to consider. If
decoration alone were to be regarded, something like
fixed rules might perhaps be tyrannically laid down, but
in a picture the implicit observance of rules of composition
would be certain to make itself seen in the result,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0096" id="p0096">96</a></span>
and the undue obtrusiveness of a code of rules would be
as inimical to the supremacy of ideas and feelings, as the
excessive prominence of fact would be, which has already
been described.</p>

<p>Hence the difficulty in prescribing any definite
course for the beginner, because whilst to most instinctive
artistic temperaments a certain knowledge of or
feeling for composition is natural, so soon as this is reduced
to definite rule and given to another, the, as it were,
secondhand use, is nearly certain to betray itself by its
misapplication. I would ask therefore that any suggestions
given here on the subject of composition should
be taken as one takes lessons in the rudiments of a
language, which rudiments we violate and forget so soon
as we have become proficient enough to speak it. <i>Such
rules in composition should be observed only so far as to avoid
the appearance of having infringed or ignored them.</i></p>

<p>The rules of composition which may be found to
apply in one of the pictorial arts must necessarily apply
equally in the others, and so therefore to pictorial photography
which at least aspires to be considered an art.
If on a sheet of paper a rectangular space is given us
wherein to draw the likeness of anything, the most
natural course to pursue would be to draw that figure in
the centre or thereabouts, and if then we are asked to
add the likeness of two or three more objects we should
naturally place these near the first object. Thus should
we compose a group of objects which draw the attention
to the middle of the picture or space.</p>

<p>Suppose we are asked to draw the picture of a
church tower we should probably comply with the
request somewhat as shown in fig. 1. Next we will
suppose we are asked to add a cottage, some trees, and
a path to the church, we should, if possessed of some
sense of symmetry and order, coupled with average<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0097" id="p0097">97</a></span>
intelligence, make the additions somewhat as in fig. 2.
It would surely be an unusual thing to follow instead
the course suggested by figs. 3 and 4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 1 and 2.">
	<a name="cp0097ab" id="cp0097ab" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0097-a-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 1" />
	<img src="images/cp0097-b-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 2" />
</div>

<br />
<p>In figs. 1 and 2 we have instinctively placed the
primary object in or near the centre, and the others near
and around it, and the result strikes one at once as being
better composed, that is, more symmetrical, than in fig.
4, in which amongst other things one is not sure which
object to regard as the principal one, and one also feels
that but for the boundaries of the picture left and right
we might have seen a good deal more beyond, which
would have added to the interest of the picture.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 3 and 4.">
	<a name="cp0097cd" id="cp0097cd" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0097-c-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 3" />
	<img src="images/cp0097-d-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 4" />
</div>

<br />
<p>In this we have one of the first rules in composition,
namely, that the principal object should be near the
centre, and the next important near to, and as it were
supporting it, and no object likely to attract the eye
should be so near the edge of the picture as to make us
instantly conscious of the boundaries and wish to see
more beyond.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0098" id="p0098">98</a></span>

<p>But now if in compliance with the supposed request
we had made our drawing as in fig. 5, might it not at
once be felt by the observer that we had put the objects
in a central position <i>intentionally</i>, which is equivalent to
saying that we had allowed our endeavour to observe the
rule just laid down to betray itself. Fig. 2 is preferable
as being only just sufficiently symmetrical to avoid being
unsymmetrical, which is an example of what has already
been said about the necessity of observing rules of composition
just so far as to escape the appearance of having
broken them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 5 and 6.">
	<a name="cp0098ab" id="cp0098ab" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0098-a-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 5" />
	<img src="images/cp0098-b-300.png" width="300" height="240" alt="fig 6" /><br />
	<span class="figcap">
		Fig. 5.<span style="margin-left: 19em;">Fig. 6.</span>
	</span>
</div>

<p>If this rule is right as regards voluntarily drawing a
picture, it is equally so in the case of a photograph, but
instead of deliberately placing things in such and such
positions, we attain the same end by moving the camera
and selecting our point of view so that the objects come
into the positions desired.</p>

<p>Now suppose then, we have done this, but in doing it
we are quite unable to prevent other objects coming into
the field of view and occupying undesirable places near
the margins of the picture, as for instance in fig. 6.
Here we are brought to consider another rule or principle
in composition, namely, that there must be one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0099" id="p0099">99</a></span>
only one chief object in the picture, whereas in fig. 6,
apart from the gate and tree on the one side and the
windmill on the other attracting attention to the margins
of the picture, these same objects arrest the attention
quite as much as the church, and we feel the eye
wandering about from one to the other and missing
the sensation of centralization and rest which fig. 2
gives.</p>

<p>If we were drawing or painting we should put in
what we want and then stop, we should omit or ignore
what we did not require, but in photography our powers
in this direction are limited, and hence we must as far as
possible select those views, and only accept such, as
comply with what we feel to be right.</p>

<p>The angle of view included by different lenses is an
auxiliary not to be neglected, for by substituting a
narrower angle lens, that is, one of longer focus, we may
cut off or leave out undesirable objects which the shorter
focus lens might include. Then again, when the print
is finished we can after careful consideration cut off what
would have been better left out, for it will be better to
have a picture half the size well composed, than double
the number of inches with a distracting and unsatisfactory
arrangement of objects, hence with many most
successful workers it is no uncommon thing to take
quite a small portion of a negative, and either print it as
it is or else enlarge it up to the desired size, but mere
size will reckon as nothing as compared with pleasing
composition.</p>

<p>If it is inexpedient to let the principal object or
group of objects occupy the exact centre of the picture,
measured from left to right, it is equally so if the centre
be measured from top to bottom, and hence we may
formulate the rule (to be broken perhaps later when we
are strong enough to be independent of guiding) that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0100" id="p0100">100</a></span>
horizon should not be allowed to come midway between
the top and the base of the picture.</p>

<p>Remembering now that, as set forth in the earlier
part of this article, a picture should appeal to our feelings
and stir our emotions, it may be pointed out that in
most ordinary things, and certainly in the arts, the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0101" id="p0101">101</a></span>
powerful things are those which possess <i>one</i> dominant
idea or feature, as in a piece of music the refrain keeps
recurring, a preacher takes a text, in a story there is <i>one</i>
hero, and so forth, and in point of composition fig. 7 is
better than fig. 8, although the view is less comprehensive.</p>

<p>It may not, however, always be easy for the
beginner to determine what is the chief object which
should occupy the central position, or which object or
group to choose in a landscape.</p>

<br />
<p>This brings us to speak of another important matter,
and that is the right disposition of lines which form the
view or the selection of view so that the lines formed by
the component parts shall fall in a desirable manner.
The various objects in any view tend to form or suggest
lines, thus in fig. 9 the outline of the trees, the bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0102" id="p0102">102</a></span>
along the shore, the clouds, and the boats suggest the
lines shown in the diagram, fig. 10, which lines all run
the same way, but in fig. 11 we have a similar view in
which the lines suggested counterbalance each other,
and not only so, but by their convergence they carry the
eye to a spot near the centre, and so make the boat,
although not very large nor conspicuous, the one and
principal object (see diagram <a href="#cp0102ab">fig. 12</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig 11 and 12">

<p>For the sake of training one's perceptions look at
any good pictures, and in your mind resolve them into
line diagrams and see how these lines fall, and in considering
any landscape or other subject to be photographed
make up your mind as to what lines are
suggested, and then select your point of view so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0103" id="p0103">103</a></span>
these lines balance or are symmetrical in arrangement,
and also that they converge towards some point well
within the picture, and near the centre of it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig 13 and 14">
	<a name="cp0103ab" id="cp0103ab" ></a>

</div>

<p>But in fig. 13 we have a subject in part well composed,
but the composition is spoilt because of the line
formed by the road and fence, which seem to cut the
picture in two, whereas could we have chosen the same
subject from a point of view giving such an arrangement
as fig. 14, a difference is at once felt and a more pleasing
effect gained.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0104" id="p0104">104</a></span>

<p>Lines which seem to separate us from the picture
and cut off one part from another must be carefully
avoided, and an endeavour to find something which will,
as it were, lead the eye into the picture, should be
diligently sought for, and indeed a subject, however it
may interest us, must often be abandoned if it lacks those
things which go to make pleasing composition, remembering
as we should always do that in pictorial work the
fact that objects are curious, or interesting, or pretty, has
nothing to do with the case, but that they are only to
be valued according as they act as media for expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0105" id="p0105">105</a></span>
pleasing ideas, beautiful thoughts and sentiments, which
they will not do if some part creates a feeling of unpleasing
arrangement or design. If a scene does not
compose well, we should as pictorial workers feel no
desire to reproduce it. But you may say "Cannot we
often by changing our point of view get an otherwise ill-composed
subject to compose well?" Most decidedly,
that is precisely what we should do, but it is no longer
the same subject or view.</p>

<p>And now let me say that it is often surprising how
much alteration may be made by changing our position.
Figs. 15 and 16 are together an instance of this, the
outline here given being made from a pencil sketch made
on the spot, whilst figs. 17 and 18 are examples of
the desirable change brought about by watching and
waiting for a change in the position of light and the
condition of the river's tide.</p>

<br />
<p>Where the beginner most often fails is in taking
things as they are without pausing to consider whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0106" id="p0106">106</a></span>
they might not be improved, and if so in what way, and
then patiently searching to see if such better way can be
found.</p>

<p>Pictorial success will as often as not depend on the
exercise of fastidious taste, which is satisfied with
nothing but the very best, and not quite content even
then.</p>

<p>A great deal more might usefully be said with
reference to the composition of lines if space would
permit, but this general reference may be given as a
sort of summing up.</p>

<p>If the disposition of the lines constitutes such a
perfectly symmetrical design that it is at once
recognised as symmetrical, then it is wrong, because the
artifice by which pleasing composition is attained is
betrayed, and we feel the thing to be artificial. If, on
the other hand, the lines fall so as to make the beholder
conscious of their presence, as, for instance, cutting off
a portion of the subject or presenting a one-sided
appearance, again it is wrong. <i>In neither case should the
lines or the objects suggesting them be felt at all until sought
for, neither as being very right or very wrong.</i></p>

<p>In art it is a maxim that the means by which the
thing is done should not proclaim itself, and hence it
must apply to pictorial photography, which is an effort
after the artistic. A composition should please without
our quite knowing why, and without our being able to
see the machinery, as it were, by which our pleasurable
sensations are set in motion.</p>

<p>But whilst it is convenient to speak of <i>lines</i> in the
landscape, it is only a manner of speaking, for, as we
know very well, photography, unlike pen drawing, has to
do with "tones," that is, <i>masses</i> of light and shade. Now
the general rules suggested as regards the arrangement
of lines, apply in much the same way if we regard a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0107" id="p0107">107</a></span>
picture (as we should do) as consisting of masses of
light and shade.</p>

<p>If when standing before a picture we close the eyes
and then suddenly open them, our attention is certain to
be drawn to the highest light or the deepest shadow,
and hence, as a general rule, whichever of these is the
strongest to attract attention, that should be in or near
the principal object (indeed it will make of itself the
principal object), and should therefore be well removed
from the margins of the picture.</p>

<p>Refer back to fig. 8, in which the light patch of sky,
the light in the water and the two clusters of light rushes,
all form competing points of attraction, and if these
are too near the margins, they remind us of those
margins, hence the improvement in effect when these
are cut away or left out.</p>

<p>But disposing of the highest light and deepest
dark does not finish the matter. There is a certain
relative degree of lightness and darkness between everything
in nature. Moreover, colours have to be interpreted
by certain degrees of light and shade according
to the distance objects are away from us, and according
to the amount of light falling on them.</p>

<p>Such relative lightness and darkness is called "<i>tone</i>."
The word used in this sense has nothing to do with
"tone" as applied to the colour of a print, which colour
we change by a process we call "toning," and upon
the correct rendering of relative tones so much of the effect
of a picture depends, and so much of its emotional qualities.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, although there are often exceptions,
the further an object is from us the grayer it
seems. White becomes less white, and dark objects
grow less dark, until in the distance both, under ordinary
circumstances, come almost to the same "tone," and we
see the distance only as a gray hazy mass.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0108" id="p0108">108</a></span>

<p>If for a subject we have a figure of a woman by a
stream of water and we make an under-exposed negative
of it, or develop the negative to too great a density, we
shall very likely have a print in which the water and the
woman's apron and cap come very much whiter with
regard to the rest of the subject than ever they appear
in nature, whilst the distance will very likely come too
dark. Here we show a disregard for the correct rendering
of relative tones and the effect is hard and harsh, unlike
nature. We must therefore endeavour, both in exposure
and development and printing, to preserve relative tones
exactly as they are in nature, and constant study and
observation of nature should be carried on in order that
the eye may be trained to know how things come
relatively in nature, and so be able to decide at a glance
if the photograph is good.</p>

<p>Ultimate success, by the way, often depends less on
knowing what to take and how to take it than on a well-trained
judgment which knows what is good or bad
when we have taken it.</p>

<p>Whilst the mere lines or forms of objects may
impart some amount of feeling and sentiment to a scene,
inasmuch as there is restfulness and repose in the long
horizontal lines of the river-side pastures, something
rhythmical in the sinuous curves of the winding stream,
or vigour and variety in the irregular forms of the rugged
cliffs and so on, yet the ideas and feelings which the picture
will promote depend more on the lights and shades, and
the masses contrasting or merging each with each.</p>

<p>But Nature does not always present herself in
pleasingly arranged masses, and is consequently at such
times commonplace and unpicturesque in the literal
sense of the word. At such times she will not attract
the pictorial worker any more than she will when perchance
the lines and groupings are unsuitable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0109" id="p0109">109</a></span>

<p>The landscape which basks under the full blaze of
sun, glittering throughout every inch with a myriad
twinkling lights and sharp details, awakens no feeling
akin to those which probably everyone feels when in the
twilight of evening plane after plane recedes as one
broad flat tint behind the other. Under the bright light
of day we may wonder at the richness and plenty upon
the earth, we may rejoice in that there are so many
curious and pretty things to look at, but these are like the
feelings inspired by reading a book on natural history,
rather than the emotions created by the perusal of a
poem, or listening to sweet music.</p>

<p>Compare for a moment the two photographs, fig. 19
and fig. 20.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig 19">
	<a name="cp0109" id="cp0109" ></a>

	<br />
	<span class="figcap">Fig. 19.</span>
</div>

<p>The first is by no means an extreme case of the
ordinary photograph, and notice that although the composition
is fairly good as far as grouping goes, there is
an absence of any quality which might make one feel
anything outside the bare recognition of the facts<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0110" id="p0110">110</a></span>
depicted, but the second, if it be good at all, must
depend for admiration on a certain amount of sentiment
which it suggests or creates. You will notice that in the
first there is no sense of distance, and although a
church tower, behind the masts of the boats, is half a
mile or so away it does not possess the "tone" and
veiling of atmosphere which would make it appear
distant. Every part of the view seems equally near, or
nearly so; the eye wanders over the whole, alighting on
details here and there which interest and amuse, yet
there is an absence of just that breadth which is
noticeably present in the second example.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig 20">
	<a name="cp0110" id="cp0110" ></a>
<img src="images/cp0110-500.jpg" width="359" height="500" alt="fig 20" />
<br />
	<span class="figcap">Fig. 20.</span>
</div>

<br />
<p>Now let it be distinctly understood that detail, its
omission or suppression, and its introduction or sharp
delineation, is not a question of lens focus only, or even
chiefly, but it is largely a question of light. Imagine the
photograph, fig. 19, with the greater part of the detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0111" id="p0111">111</a></span>
taken out so that the quay, the houses, the shore, etc.
were just broad masses of lighter or darker tone, should
we not then get a composition which would be less
disturbing, more compact, more concentrated in interest?
Is not this the case in fig. 20, in which detail is almost
entirely absent? And yet detail could not have been
truthfully introduced in this photograph, because with
the light in the position it is, and in the misty evening
air, <i>no detail was there to reproduce</i>; it was the fact that
objects ranged themselves in masses one against the
other, leaving room for imagination and creating ideas
that determined its selection and its consequent portrayal.</p>

<p>In many cases a clear and sharp delineation of
details will perhaps be desirable, not, however, for the
sake of showing detail, but just so far as the production
of the effect may require; on the other hand, just the
full amount of detail that a lens will give is by no means
always wanted.</p>

<p><i>Lenses were not invented for pictorial purposes</i>, and therefore
there is no reason for concluding that what the lens
gives is necessarily right, for remember that we started
with the distinct understanding that we were merely
<i>applying</i> to a certain purpose just so much of the photographic
process as we considered we needed; because I
have the means of travelling at sixty miles an hour there
is no reason why I should not apply the same means of
locomotion to coaching a pedestrian at a tenth of that
speed if I choose. It may be said that in the two
photographs referred to the comparison is not a fair one,
because so much depends on the sky. Granted that
much in the second example does depend on the sky,
which is an essential part of the picture, and indeed one
cause of its very existence, but in the other (fig. 19) the
presence of clouds would not improve the pictorial faults
to which reference has been made. As a mere record or<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0112" id="p0112">112</a></span>
portrayal of Old Woodbridge Quay, the absence of
clouds is as much a characteristic of its particular species,
as the clouds in the second one are inseparable from its
existence.</p>

<p>So, but little more than half hinting at the principles
involved in the due suppression of unnecessary details, and
the elimination of undesirable objects in order to obtain
breadth, and having said but little as to the preservation
of correct relative values or tones, I must pass on.</p>

<p>Every corner of nature's broad expanse is, as it
were, enveloped in atmosphere, and invisible as we are
commonly in the habit of considering it to be, it affects
to a greater or less degree everything we see, and the
visible atmosphere is often responsible for some of
nature's most beautiful and most appealing aspects.
Obviously then we cannot afford to leave out so
important a contributory to picturesque effect, and it is
on this account rather than on account of sharp or un-sharp
detail that the question of stops and lens apertures
comes in.</p>

<p>Look at the image of a landscape on a moderately
hazy day, as it appears on the ground-glass focussing
screen of your camera, using the lens at full aperture&mdash;then
quickly insert <i>f</i>/32, and notice the difference. Not
alone have objects near at hand and more remote become
more sharply or more equally defined, but you may also
notice that objects are <i>more brilliant</i>, and that a sense of
atmosphere has been cut out.</p>

<p>Compare if you will two photographs, the one made
respectively with full aperture of <i>f</i>/6 or <i>f</i>/8 and the other
made with <i>f</i>/32 or <i>f</i>/45, and provided that in the first case
we have not actual blurring to the extent of destroying
form and structure, does not the first remind you more of
nature? I do not say it is so instructive, so surprising,
so dainty, or of such exquisite finish, but is it not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0113" id="p0113">113</a></span>
reminiscent of the <i>effects</i> we remember to have seen and
<i>felt</i> in nature. It is not the function of this article to say
to what optical laws this difference is due, and yet
the student may expect to receive something by way
of practical working instructions.</p>

<p>My recommendation is then to use a single landscape
lens or the single combination of a doublet, and in
starting to use the full aperture.</p>

<p>With this it may be that when the foreground is
moderately sharp, trees more remote are so ill defined as
to appear as a collection of little blots and irregular
patches. Whilst sharp detail in all places may not be
productive of pictorial effect, yet the extreme opposite
will be displeasing in another way, and it will be best to
secure just <i>so much definition and no more</i> as shall save the
representation from appearing to have been wilfully put
out of focus&mdash;once let the destruction of detail be obvious
and we betray the artifice by which we are working,
which is just what we should avoid.</p>

<p>In the case just supposed then, we may now introduce
the first stop, simultaneously racking the lens in a
little until we get middle distance without unpleasantly
obvious blurring. The foreground may be a little out of
focus, and in practice I find it is rather helpful to general
effect if detail is sacrificed more in the foreground than
in the middle distance.</p>

<p>This I believe is contrary to the teaching of many,
but my feeling is that with a sharply defined foreground
the eye is attracted and the interest so far arrested, that
it is difficult to travel further and enter into the poetry
and sentiment of the scene beyond.</p>

<p>Wide-angle lenses have a double disadvantage,
shared in part by so-called rapid rectilinear doublet
lenses. In the first place they flatten the view, bringing
distant planes to appear as near as the nearer ones, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0114" id="p0114">114</a></span>
by including a comparatively wide angle they bring into
the plane of the foreground, objects so near that they
appear out of proportion, and hence proportions are false
when judged as the observer must judge by the standard
of visual perspective.</p>

<p>A long-focus, narrow-angle lens necessitates a
camera which racks out to a considerable length, and
probably a greater extension than any camera in the
ordinary way can give, would be an advantage on some
occasions.</p>

<p>Passing reference has been made to the interpretation
of colours in nature in their true relative value of
black and white.</p>

<p>If we have a subject in which brilliant orange-coloured
rushes in autumn are seen as glowing bright
against a background of dark blue water, and the rushes
made still more golden of hue by the ruddy rays of a
sinking sun, a difficult case is before us.</p>

<p>Such a case I remember very well in the south of
Devonshire, close to what is known as Slapton Ley.
It was late afternoon in November, and from over
the rounded hills behind me to the westward, the
declining sun sent warm red rays on to the belt of
faded reeds which stretched out into the expanse
of the still land-locked water of the Ley&mdash;a great sheet
of fresh water which placidly lay under the shelter of
the bank of shingle which alone separated it from the
ever-restless sea&mdash;placidly listening to the ceaseless
voices of sea music, and at this particular hour reflecting
the sky deep blue and of almost leaden hue&mdash;just above
the bank rose the full moon, orange in tint, on a background
of blue-green sky&mdash;the yellow reeds, kindled into
glowing amber tints by the sun's rays, flamed out from
the deep blue water&mdash;yellow the shingle bank against
the blue water and green-blue sky, deeper yellow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0115" id="p0115">115</a></span>
moon as it rose from out the sea. So grand a scheme
of colour that by its side the essays of the most daring
painter might well seem feeble, so exquisite a poem that
the intrusion of the photographer, analysing the values
and tones and calculating his powers of reproduction
seemed like sacrilege. In the main it was yellow, orange-yellow,
and red standing out as luminous against the deep
blue of water and only a little less blue sky. It was
gorgeous non-actinic colour appearing as <i>light</i> against a
highly actinic but <i>darker</i> colour. The consequence of an
indiscreet exposure with an ordinary plate might be
anticipated to produce <i>dark</i> rushes against a <i>pale grey</i>
background of water, and so probably the very effect we
were minded to secure, reversed and dissipated.</p>

<p>This is an extreme case, perhaps, but throughout
the whole range of nature the contrasting and blending
of adjacent colours is so subtle a thing that I should feel
one were throwing away at least a possible advantage
by not using colour-corrected or isochromatic plates on
nearly every occasion, and in order to get the full
advantage of isochromatic plates, I should consider the
addition of a yellow screen an essential.</p>

<p>The rapidity of one's plates, isochromatic or otherwise,
must be governed entirely by the nature of the
subject, as also to some degree must be development
and subsequent printing.</p>

<p>In every case I would endeavour to get a comparatively
thin negative, with even the portions representing
deepest shadows slightly veiled. "Clear glass shadows"
is an enormity and an outrage both of science and art;
equally are solid high-lights to be shunned. With
modern printing methods it needs much less than actual
opacity in the negative to produce white paper, and if
the picture requires any part of it at all to appear as
quite white, no subject will need more than the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0116" id="p0116">116</a></span>
smallest region to be so. A general softness and very
subtle gradation, with a total absence of "sparkle" and
brilliancy in the negative, will yield by at least most
processes the most suggestive print, bearing in mind
that delicate gradations suggest atmosphere, and atmosphere
is one of nature's most precious qualities.</p>

<p>Whilst plain salted papers sensitized with silver
present possibilities not yet sufficiently exploited, yet
until such time that something more entirely satisfactory
in all respects is given us in silver papers, platinotype
and carbon, and perhaps also gum bichromate will be the
processes most suitable for our purpose. Personally,
platinotype has been the favoured medium, being, as I
believe, more ductile and more amenable to various
methods of control than is generally recognised.</p>

<p>And leaving much more of importance unsaid than
space limits admit of my saying, I must leave it.</p>

<p>To the majority
amateurs, the photographing
of architectural
subjects presents considerable,
and in many cases
apparently insurmountable
difficulties. Undoubtedly
there are difficulties to be
grappled with, but they are
neither so formidable nor so
numerous, but that any
ordinary photographer with
the average amount of common
sense can master them
be he so minded.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are
a great many who take up
photography as an amusement
to whom the slightest
departure from the ordinary
routine presents a difficulty.
It is however to the amateur
photographer who desires to be able to portray architecture,
be it either of our cathedrals, churches, historic
mansions, or places of personal interest, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0118" id="p0118">118</a></span>
time wishes to be able to do the subjects fair justice, that
it is hoped the following particulars may be of some
service.</p>

<p>To the beginner taking up this or indeed any branch
of photography, size is of course a great consideration
either from the weight carrying or pecuniary point of
view. Another reason is the fact that young photographic
workers have an idea that the smaller the plate, the
easier the working. Sound though this reasoning may
appear, nevertheless it is not entirely correct.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact all things being taken into consideration
the larger the plate up to 12 × 10 or 15 × 12
employed the more rapidly will the worker progress.</p>

<p>Large plates, especially in architectural work, tend
to make the operator more careful and conscientious when
out with the camera; and even more so when in the
developing room. So much more can be done with a
large plate than with a small one; the use of a large
plate moreover checks the common failing so prevalent
among amateurs of rushing work and recklessly using
plates.</p>

<p>Taking all things into consideration, I would strongly
recommend the whole plate or 10 × 8 camera to the
student taking up this branch of our art.</p>

<p>In selecting a camera purchase a front extending
one with bellows only slightly tapering. See that it has
both rising and cross movement to the front, and also
that the amount of movement in each case is a not too
restricted one. Makers, unfortunately, do not give
sufficient attention to this matter, the usual rise allowed
being very slight whereas it should be at least equal
to one-third of the longest way of the plate; even more
than this is advantageous if it can be obtained. By
the rise I mean the amount of upward movement that
can be obtained, the lens being in the centre before starting.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0119" id="p0119">119</a></span>

<p>The cross-front should have a movement of about
one-quarter of the length of the plate each way.</p>

<p>It may be useful to know that a little more rise can
be obtained by the placing of the lens above the centre
of the cross-front; reference to the photograph of camera
will explain this matter more fully.</p>

<p>The swing-back should be a practical one, working
from the centre, and capable of being swung either to or
from the lens.</p>

<p>In many of the cheaper front extension cameras it is
not possible to use the swing-back when tilting the
camera down, only when tilting upwards. The swing-front,
although not an absolute necessity, is undoubtedly
a movement possessing great advantages, especially
when the front is raised rather high, and one is using a
lens of limited covering power. This movement
should be acquired if possible.</p>

<p>The camera should possess double extension, focussing
by rackwork, and having a reversing back so made
that it will fit on all ways; it is then possible to draw
the slide shutter out in any position.</p>

<p>In selecting a tripod stand purchase one of the kind
known as the sliding leg variety, two-fold is better than
three, giving greater sliding power. The top of stand
should be as large as possible; this is preferable to a
turntable, as this piece of workmanship is seldom rigid
after a little use, and some difficulty is experienced when
trying to spread the legs out rather wide. A two-fold
Ashford stand is as good as any on the market.</p>

<p>The blocks herewith illustrate the kind of camera
used by myself, and with the exception of the turntable,
which is not a great success, it answers all requirements.</p>

<p>In the selecting of suitable lenses a great deal will
depend upon the inclination of the purchaser and the
depth of his pocket.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0120" id="p0120">120</a></span>

<p>There is such a great variety upon the market at
the present time, that to the young photographer the
buying of the right lenses is somewhat a difficult
problem.</p>

</div>

<p>The Zeiss series are undoubtedly the finest obtainable
and for architectural work are unrivalled, possessing
great covering power, good marginal definition, and in
fact very fine definition all over the plate. The lenses
of this series, although quite new, have met with great
favour amongst architectural workers.</p>

<p>They work at an aperture of <i>f</i>/18, but I understand
that they can be opened to <i>f</i>/16 and numbered on the <i>f</i>
system. As regards their relative working capabilities
they give about the same picture at <i>f</i>/32 that the
majority of wide-angle lenses give at <i>f</i>/64.</p>

<p>The Goerz anastigmats are also another very fine
series but do not give anything like the covering power
of the last mentioned, and moreover are nearly double
the price. Their special merit is that one can work<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0121" id="p0121">121</a></span>
at <i>f</i>/8 or <i>f</i>/11, and get a picture sharp up to the edges.
Taylor, Taylor &amp; Hobson also make a good wide-angle
lens, possessing great covering power and at a moderately
low price. With one of their nine inch lenses I have
covered a plate 12 × 10 inches.</p>

<p>For a whole-plate camera, a useful battery would be
a 5 inches, 7&frac12; inches, 9 inches and 12 inches; for 10 × 8,
7 inches, 9 inches, 10&frac12; inches and 14 inches. The three
last in each case are the most useful.</p>

<p>Having selected the lenses, another very important
point and one not to be decided hastily is the question of
levels. Four are required, two circular and two ordinary.
They are placed as follows: Fix the circular levels, one
on the baseboard near the front of the camera, the other
on the top of the back part of camera. The other two
should be placed one on the side of the back part and the
other on the back of camera just under the reversing
back. Care must be taken to purchase slow moving
levels as some work so quickly that it is next to
impossible to level the camera with them, and as this
is one of the most important points in the whole business,
too much care cannot be taken in selecting and fixing the
right kind of level.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Focusing Screen">
	<a name="cp0121" id="cp0121" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0121-250.png" width="250" height="192" alt="focusing screen" />
</div>


<p>The focussing screen should be ruled as accompanying
diagram. This will divide the screen into inch
squares, working from the centre, and will considerably
assist the photographer in "sizing his subject up."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0122" id="p0122">122</a></span>

<p>One other thing required is a set of clamps for
binding the tripod legs together. These are, I believe,
made by George Mason, of Glasgow, but any dealer will
procure them for you.</p>

<p>The use of the right kind of plate constitutes a very
important factor in the production of a satisfactory
negative, particularly in this branch.</p>

<p>Owing to the greater difficulty experienced in developing
extra rapid plates, one generally sees the slower
variety recommended. No hard and fast rule can however
be laid down. To gain the best result, the plate
must be suited to the subject.</p>

<p>For instance, in a very dark interior in which heavy
black shadows predominate, many of them appearing
much darker than they really are owing to their close
proximity to a strong light, the quicker the plate used
the better. This tends to break down the harsh contrasts,
and at the same time the shadow detail is considerably
better rendered.</p>

<p>On the other hand, working in a light interior or one
which is flat owing possibly to the large amount of light
present, a slower plate can be used with advantage, and,
providing the exposure is sufficient the result will be all
that is wished for.</p>

<p>Exteriors, particularly those in sunshine, should be
photographed on a fairly quick plate. Slow plates,
although good, do not yield nearly such good negatives,
and unless very fully exposed give excessive hardness.</p>

<p>Taking this class of work all round, the quick plate
is the more useful of the two and is undoubtedly the best
for interior work, particularly such interiors as one meets
in our English cathedrals.</p>

<p>For all subjects possessing strong high-lights, such
as windows, stained or otherwise, rapid plates combined
with a suitable backing composition yield the best results,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0123" id="p0123">123</a></span>
and I would impress upon the reader the fact that no
plate should ever be placed in a dark slide without being
covered at the back with a suitable composition for the
prevention of halation.</p>
<br />

<div class="figcenter" title="Example 1">
	<a name="cp0123" id="cp0123" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0123-500.jpg" width="371" height="500" alt="Example 1" />
</div>
<br />

<p>The value of this agent is distinctly demonstrated
by the accompanying illustrations, and I would point out
the fact that the negatives were both developed with the
utmost care. The unbacked plate was so developed as
to prevent the appearance of halation as much as possible,
and it will be noticed that all portions of the photograph,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0124" id="p0124">124</a></span>
other than that where halation has occurred, are nearly as
good in the unbacked as in the backed one.</p>

<p>Having obtained all the apparatus and materials, a
very good subject to begin on and one giving good
opportunities for the exercise of the various movements
connected with the camera, etc., is a general view of the
choir in some cathedral or church near at hand.</p>

<p>Having erected the camera, the next thing is to decide
upon the most pleasing point of view.</p>

<p>Speaking from my own experience I would advise
the shifting of the camera either to the right or left, so
that the centre aisle is thrown slightly in perspective.
This tends to give a much better and decidedly more
pleasing effect to the resulting photograph. Of the two
sides, moving to the right seems to be the best. The
next item is the fixing of your ground line, this must be
so arranged that it is quite clear, not obstructed by
the backs of chairs, etc., which look very badly if left
standing. Personally, I have generally found it necessary
to move one or two rows of chairs so as to make the
ground line myself.</p>

<p>In adjusting the height of the camera from the
ground it is well never to exceed six feet. Five feet to
five feet six inches is the most useful height. This will
give a photograph in which the point of sight is the
same as that of the person actually viewing the subject.</p>

<p>The placing of the camera on step ladders, chairs,
or other supports, so as to overlook objects in the
immediate foreground is a practice to be condemned,
giving results very rarely pleasing and always bad from
the sightseer's point of view.</p>

<p>Having settled upon the point of view and the lens
to be used, the student should then roughly focus the
image. Notice the amount of subject on the plate and
how much rise is required.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0125" id="p0125">125</a></span>

<p>If having a camera such as described, the rise is
easily accomplished and the camera can then be truly
levelled up. Care should be taken over this as unless
you have the camera exactly level you cannot expect a
true picture. The bubbles of the levels should be <i>exactly</i>
in the centre, <i>a little bit out will not do</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Example 2">
	<a name="cp0125" id="cp0125" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0125-500.jpg" width="373" height="500" alt="Example 2" />
</div>

<p>If it is found that the rising front fails to give the
amount of subject required, recourse must be made to
the swings, and it is here that the swing front triumphs
over the swing back.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0126" id="p0126">126</a></span>

<p>To swing the back necessitates the shifting of the
camera and tripod stand, and at once throws all the
levels out of gear. Then comes re-focussing, etc. Sometimes
this will have to be gone through five or six times
before the desired amount of swing has been achieved.
Owing to the re-focussing required every time the camera
is moved it is very difficult, especially for the beginner,
to rightly estimate the amount of rise required.</p>

<p>With the swing front the desired amount of rise is
attained easily and quickly, and it can be worked with
the head still under the focussing cloth, which is a great
convenience. At the same time the baseboard and back
of camera always remain level.</p>

<p>After gaining the correct amount of rise the sides of
the subject should be considered. A golden rule to
remember in this class of work is when you show a
column, show the base of it, and always start the sides
of plate with either half or three-quarters of a column.
It looks very queer to see the bend of an arch wandering
away out of the side of the picture without any apparent
support. In arranging the sides it is usual to have a
preponderance of subject on the opposite side to which
the camera is, and to start that side with a column.
Sometimes the subject fails to fit the plate nicely, in that
case it is better to trim the print than to have uninteresting
features present.</p>

<p>Of course a great deal depends upon the personal
taste of the worker, what one man considers right
another will rebel against; so although I advocate the
use of columns to fill the sides of the plate it does not
follow that that is the one and only method of photographing
these subjects.</p>

<p>The student having carefully gone into these matters
and arranged the subjects to suit his own satisfaction the
question of what point to focus for arises, and indeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0127" id="p0127">127</a></span>
very dark interiors the question of focussing anything at
all comes in. A method I use myself is to roughly
divide the distance from the camera to the farthest object
in half, and then to focus midway between the camera
and the middle of the subject. Then stop down the lens
until the most distant object is sharp. In practice I
have found this rule so good that I can recommend its
adoption for all subjects, and if carried out correctly will
always result in the production of crisp negatives.</p>

<p>Exposure is not a very difficult thing to overcome.
Arrange the focussing cloth well over the head, open the
lens out to its largest aperture and remain under the
cloth until you can see the image distinctly all over the
plate. Then without uncovering the head proceed to
slowly stop down until you can only just see the image
all over the plate. Now using a plate of the rapidity of
Barnet extra rapid, an exposure of ten minutes will yield
a satisfactory fully exposed negative.</p>

<p>The varying exposures for other plates and stops
are easily obtained. For instance you find the image
can just be seen all over at <i>f</i>/32 and you wish to use <i>f</i>/64
The exposure will be forty minutes.</p>

<p>After having used this method for over seven years,
and having invariably found it correct, I can unhesitatingly
recommend its adoption, and if used with a
little common sense the worker will seldom suffer from
his plates being either badly under or over-exposed.</p>

<p>In photographing side aisles, transepts, or long rows
of pillars, the worker is often troubled by the unnatural
way in which the floor runs up. This is more especially
noticeable when there are no prominent objects in the
immediate foreground. A considerable amount of this
can however be overcome by the lowering of the camera
to about three feet from the ground. It is here where
the sliding legs of the tripod stand become of service.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0128" id="p0128">128</a></span>

<p>I would ask the student always to use the
longest focus lens possible, consistent with the effect
desired.</p>

<p>The use of extreme wide-angle lenses has had a
disastrous effect upon the public taste in respect to architectural
photography due principally to the abortions
one sees exposed for sale in the shop windows of our
cathedral cities.</p>

<p>It should be seldom necessary for the amateur to
use very wide-angle lenses. Of course, when it is a
question of getting a detailed photograph in a confined
situation a wide-angle lens is of great service. But it is
when you see the whole length of a cathedral photographed
on a whole plate with a five inch lens that the
fault is so noticeable.</p>

<p>In photographing exteriors great care should be
taken in the placing of the camera in a suitable spot.
Try and so arrange it that the short side of the building
does not run off too violently, indeed, it is often much
better to leave out a portion of the subject rather than
to cram the whole subject upon the plate.</p>

<p>General views are much better if photographed
when there is a little sunlight. This gives to the subject
a sharp, clean-cut appearance.</p>

<p>Details on the other hand are better if photographed
in a subdued light and slightly over-exposed.</p>

<p>In focussing very high subjects some difficulty will
be found in getting bottom and top in focus at the same
time, especially if the lens be strained by either altering
the back or front of the camera.</p>

<p>The best place to focus is a little way above the
centre of the screen, so that when stopped down the
bottom of the building is quite sharp. A slight softness
towards the top of the subject is scarcely noticeable in
the final print.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0129" id="p0129">129</a></span>

<p>The exposure of exteriors varies between three
seconds at <i>f</i>/64 to ten minutes, and no correct guide can
possibly be given. To the beginner a Watkins'
exposure meter will here be of some service.</p>

<p>If people are continually passing and repassing stop
the lens down to <i>f</i>/64 and give as long an exposure as is
possible; this will as a rule completely obliterate them.
I have found that an exposure of from ten to twenty
seconds entirely destroys all trace of moving objects.</p>

<p>Another method of making an exposure where there
is much traffic past the building, and perhaps people
standing about whom you cannot very well ask to move,
is, to break the exposure as many times as possible.
Expose for two seconds, then wait until the traffic has
somewhat altered; then give another two seconds and so
on until finished. By this means I have been able to
photograph buildings in the centre of a crowded street or
thoroughfare without a trace of anybody showing.</p>

<p>It is often interesting for the student to be able to
successfully tackle the photographing of drawing-room,
ball-room, or other apartments either of his own or
friends' houses.</p>

<p>This work is considerably more difficult than it
seems; and it is in such subjects that the taste of the
operator becomes manifest. A great deal depends upon
the point of view chosen and also upon the arrangement
of the furniture.</p>

<p>If a long room, the camera should be placed at one
end at about a quarter of the width of room away from
one side and from the end wall. Keep the camera
parallel with the sides of the room and use the sliding
front so as to obtain more of the opposite side of the
room. This will give the ceiling a true square appearance
and the side of the ceiling will not run off with an
unpleasing effect.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0130" id="p0130">130</a></span>

<p>In some subjects it is perhaps necessary to include
one or more windows. This can of course be accomplished
by the aid of backed plates, but it is always
better to block those particular windows out. This is
usually done by covering the outside with black cloth or
brown paper or pulling the sun blinds down. To get
the effect of the windows you must remove the paper or
cloth at the end of the exposure for a few minutes, three
minutes being generally sufficient. By this means it is
possible to show the landscape as seen from the window.
Do not place your camera too high. Four feet to four
feet six inches is quite sufficient. If the camera is higher
you look over the immediate foreground objects, touching
the ground past them, which is undesirable.</p>

<p>In arranging the furniture be careful that round or
oval objects are not placed so that they appear on the
edges of the plate which gives them an exaggerated
appearance.</p>

<p>In exposing on all such interiors I would strongly
recommend a very full exposure, the object being to
flatten the subject. A great thing to study in this branch
of work is the careful lighting of your subject. This
can be largely varied by the use of the inside blinds, also
by the sun blinds found outside many windows. It is
<i>not</i> advisable to draw the blinds up to their fullest extent.
By so doing you accentuate your cast shadows thrown
by tables, chairs, etc. In fact, the softer the light in the
room coupled with a corresponding exposure, the better
the result. Another point to notice is that a comparatively
dull day is often the best for interior work, the light
being much softer and subdued. As a slight guide to
exposure I would suggest that an additional twenty-five
per cent. be added to that recommended for church work.</p>

<p>What is the best form
of hand camera?
How often this question is
asked, and yet how impossible
to give any definite reply,
the conditions of use, and
requirements of each worker
being so widely different.
One, desires a form of apparatus,
capable of being
closed up into the smallest
space, weighing but the least
possible number of ounces,
the necessary movements,
confined to touching a spring,
or pressing a button, and the
total cost not to exceed two
or three pounds, while
others do not care so much
as to its possessing these
qualities, if by a little increase
in bulk, weight, and cost,
it is capable of use in a less restricted manner, on
subjects of wide variety, and under such conditions of
light, and atmospheric effects, as, when shutter exposures
are being given, call for the <i>maximum light passage</i> to the
plate.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0132" id="p0132">132</a></span>

<p>Assuming the camera to be intended exclusively
for use without a tripod, then it becomes not a difficult
matter to point out its essential features. First and
foremost, it should be characterized by simplicity in construction,
and every part be easily accessible, complicated
movements being rarely found necessary, except
perhaps, to raise the price of the instrument. When
being employed in the field, the camera and its working
parts ought not to need the slightest consideration, each
movement, whether they be few, or many, being made,
without requiring troublesome attention at the moment
when every thought should be devoted to the subject.</p>

<p>The component parts of an instrument, complete
and effective for this class of work, may be taken to be
a good lens capable of covering at <i>f</i>/8, a shutter, some
simple means of focussing, adequate finders, and the
means of carrying plates either in some form of magazine,
or ordinary dark slides.</p>

<p>Each system of holder for plates possesses its own
distinctive advantages, which are preferable, depending
entirely on individual needs, or tastes. Some admire one
method, and some the other.</p>

<p>When plates are carried in one of the many forms
of magazine which cameras are nowadays fitted with, it
is <i>important when re-charging it</i>, that care be taken to see
<i>each sheath and plate is laid true</i> in its place, as the slightest
irregularity at this point, means certain trouble when
changing a plate after exposure, indeed, perhaps
fifty per cent. of the misfortunes which occur
when out at work, from failure to act of the changing
arrangements, <i>are directly caused by carelessness when laying
the plates in the magazine</i>. Given reasonable care in this
matter, almost any of the modern automatic changing
methods, may be relied on to answer satisfactorily.
When however the slight additional bulk, weight, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0133" id="p0133">133</a></span>
may be increase of cost is not objected to, then there
can be no denying separate dark slides possess many
and important advantages.</p>

<p>No need to fear a wasted day, caused by some plate
sticking, and rendering further work impossible, without
having recourse to a dark-room, which probably is miles
away; and again, one must not overlook the opportunity
they give of carrying plates of different degrees of sensitiveness,
a matter of service, when subjects to be dealt
with are varied, such as, say, clouds and water, landscapes
and figures. In the first case, when light is fairly good,
the ordinary speed plate will be found amply quick
enough during the daytime, and fifty per cent cheaper
in price. When open landscapes are being taken,
during summer time, medium rapid plates generally
will be quick enough, but many opportunities, for
pictorial work, arise under conditions of atmosphere
and light, in which to obtain fully exposed
negatives with a shutter, demands a plate of extreme
sensitiveness, and if for no other reason than that they
offer this opportunity of carrying a varied assortment
of plates, many workers prefer dark slides, to any form
of magazine.</p>

<p>There are advantages, and disadvantages, with both
systems, and it becomes simply a question for each
worker to consider which fulfills his requirements best.</p>

<p><i>The Lens.</i>&mdash;Good work can be, and is done, with
cheap single lenses, but the opportunities offered are
considerably restricted, what is needed, being such a
lens as may be used at full aperture of <i>f</i>/8 or <i>f</i>/6, and
will then cover the plate from corner to corner, sharply.
This is necessary not only because the actinic quality of
light is not always over good, but that moving subjects
demand the shutter should be working with rapidity,
sometimes indeed with considerable speed: under which<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0134" id="p0134">134</a></span>
conditions two factors are absolutely essential, a large
working lens aperture, and a rapid plate. It is well,
therefore, to <i>buy the best lens you can afford</i>, it more than
pays in every way. For &frac14;-plate work, a <i>rectilinear</i> of 5,
or 5&frac12; in. focus, working say at <i>f</i>/5.6, and with iris diaphragm,
by one of the best makers, will allow work being
done under any condition of weather, or other circumstances,
when shutter work is possible.</p>

<p><i>Finders.</i>&mdash;Years ago, the question of whether finders
were necessary, or not, in a camera of this kind, was a
matter on which some at least expressed very different
opinions, from those now held by most workers. Further
experience has shown that when certainty in working
is desired, some kind of finder is an absolute necessity
as part of the working mechanism. It usually takes
the form of a small camera obscura, what is required being,
that it should not be too small, should give a perfectly
discernible image, and be so adjusted, that only so much
of it is shown, as will be projected on to the sensitive
plate, when the exposure is made. The reason of its importance
is that it <i>enables the subject being arranged</i> tastefully,
as well as ensuring that the whole of it is on the plate.</p>

<p>Where no attempt at pictorial work is intended,
and the important matter is simply that the object being
photographed should be in the <i>centre of the plate</i>, then it
is only necessary that the finder should show as wide an
angle of vision, or a little wider than the lens being
employed inside the camera. But when something
more is aimed at, <i>viz.</i>: <i>Tasteful composition over the whole
plate</i>, then it is necessary to block out on the finder all
excess of view, beyond what will be received on the
sensitive plate.</p>

<p><i>The Shutter.</i>&mdash;What particular form may be best is
a matter of doubt, but whatever it be, exposure must
be possible without vibration, it should give greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0135" id="p0135">135</a></span>
exposure to the foreground than the sky, and ought to
allow of being regulated for exposures ranging from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>th of
a second up to perhaps <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th for ordinary work.</p>

<p>Where shutter work has to be done, which demands
anything less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of a second, then special shutters
for the purpose are needed, but after having used hand
cameras of one form or another for the last nine or ten
years on such classes of subjects as are ordinarily dealt
with, the occasions on which any greater speed than
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>30</sub>th of a second has been called for have been
extremely rare. It may be said this would not allow of
taking subjects such as a close finish of a cycle race
and such like, which is quite true; did occasion arise for
so doing, then a shutter such as the focal plane would
be employed as a matter of course. But by far the
greater amount of work done with hand cameras would
be the better for receiving a longer exposure, better
because light action on the sensitive plate would be
more thorough, and far better because when slowly
moving objects, such as waves rolling shoreward, are
given <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th instead of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th of a second, we get less of
"<i>petrified naturo</i>," and a more natural appearance in the
resulting photographs. As a general rule it is well to
give the <i>slowest exposure possible</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Focussing Arrangements.</i>&mdash;These need be only
very simple, and generally are done by scale to distances.
As a rule with the lens working at <i>f</i>/11, and the scale set
at 15 feet, it will be found that the depth of focus is sufficient
for most ordinary work, and any alteration in the
focussing seldom necessary, when dealing with subjects
where figures are included, that are not required to be
approached much closer than the distance mentioned.</p>

<p>So far as may be necessary for <i>hand-camera work</i>
simply, the instrument should be without complications,
is better for having a <i>good rectilinear lens</i>, needs a shutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0136" id="p0136">136</a></span>
easily adjusted for exposures ranging if possible, from a
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>th of a second, up to say <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub>th, properly adjusted finders,
some means of quickly altering the focus of lens, one
or other method of carrying the plates or films, and for
<i>purely hand-camera</i> work, there is <i>no need</i> for any other
addition to it.</p>

<p>Passing away from the camera to its use, one is
faced immediately with the fact, that in spite of the
multitude of such instruments now in use, the <i>general
average of results</i> produced by its means are, in quality,
unmistakably below those done with a camera and tripod,
nor is the reason for this far to seek. In the latter case,
a plate of medium rapidity is generally employed, such
an exposure given, as makes no serious <i>strain</i> on the
developer used to bring the latent image fully out; the
action of light having been ample, and the plate not so
easily spoiled, as one of higher sensitiveness, there is not
that call for such skilful treatment, as where light action
on a highly delicate emulsion, has been but brief, and
needs to receive careful handling, before good, well-graded
negatives may be produced.</p>

<p>To use a hand camera is the simplest matter
imaginable, to properly employ it the most difficult&mdash;simple,
because of the facility with which plates may be
exposed, difficult, because to succeed, demands careful
practice, and a thorough understanding of photographic
manipulation. We must have <i>learnt to see</i>, and that
quickly, must have gained coolness and self-restraint,
and perhaps not the <i>least qualification necessary is that of
being a good photographer</i>. Whether content to produce
good straightforward representations of such scenes as
come before you, or more ambitious attempts at pictorial
work be made, they can both be done with the hand
camera quite as well, nay indeed, given sufficient
technical skill, and trained perception to see the beauty<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0137" id="p0137">137</a></span>
presented in line and mass, it is by no means clear
this form of implement does not offer greater facilities
for successful working, than the more complicated form
used with a tripod.</p>

<p>The choice of subject is only bounded by the
limits of exposure, speed of plate and actinic action of
light available. The first has already been touched
upon, when the lens, and shutter, were dealt with.</p>

<p>Plates have recently been so increased in speed,
that it becomes necessary to somewhat modify advice,
which a year or two ago, might have been perfectly
correct, <i>viz.</i>, to work with the fastest plate procurable.
But there is this advantage now, as then, that if some
convenient form of actinometer be used to test the
light, we are able to judge at once, what speed
of plate will be necessary to deal with each subject
as it arises. There are several forms available,
amongst which, the one introduced by Watkins, made so
that it becomes a permanent part of the camera,
answers remarkably well, especially as it cannot be left
at home, without being noticed. In developing shutter-exposed
plates, if full exposure has been obtained, then
the ordinary modes of procedure suffice, so also when
over-exposure occurs, but by far the greater proportion
of failures one sees in this class of work, arise simply
<i>from under-exposure</i>. There seems so much charm in
driving a shutter at its highest speed, and at the same
time using the lens stopped down, to secure sharp
definition, the wonder is, not that failures flourish, but
that any good work is done at all.</p>

<p>With regard to particular developers there is
only this to be said. Whatever agent be employed, so
arrange that before density is obtained, <i>all the detail you
require</i> is first brought out; this simply means, if pyro is
being used, it is kept low, until the plate is ready to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0138" id="p0138">138</a></span>
treated for density, then a further addition of pyro and
bromide will generally suffice to rapidly finish off the
work.</p>

<p>When a batch of exposed plates is being dealt
with, a most certain method of negative making, will be
found in employing in one dish, either one or other of
the following one-solution developers:&mdash;</p>

<p>Any of the above developers will be found to
rapidly bring out all there is in the plate, and if over-exposure
is feared, they may all with advantage be
diluted, with an equal quantity of water, in order to slow
down their action.</p>

<p>In another dish, it is advisable to have the following
<i>re-developer</i>, to impart density to the plates, as they
become ready for that operation, or to successfully deal
with any, which are found to have been considerably
over-exposed, and upon which, the first developer is
acting too vigorously.</p>

<p>By employing two different developers in the
manner suggested, it becomes a simple matter to produce
good negatives, from plates having had all kinds
of exposures, some under, some over, and it may be
some which have had about the right exposure; in this
way one of the most fruitful causes of failure in the
production of hand-camera pictures, <i>error in exposure
and development</i>, is minimized, if not altogether done away
with.</p>

<p>There are sometimes occasions when out with a
hand camera, when subjects present themselves, offering
exceedingly good opportunities for securing pleasing
little pictures, but which require one, or two seconds'
exposure, to render them successfully. At such times it
may generally be arranged to rest the camera on a stone,
wall, or gate, or to hold it pressed against a tree, or
some other rigid support. As an example, the illustration
of a woodside with birch trees, facing page 136, may
be pointed to. In this instance, when out cycling, the
place and lighting on the tree trunks, struck us as
pleasing, and worth trying to secure a record of, even
though but a hand camera was being carried at the time.</p>

<p>Having dismounted, and found a point from where
it might be attempted, and where conveniently grew a
single tree, the lens was opened to (if recollection
does not deceive) <i>f</i>/11. Then the camera jammed
close to the tree trunk, and two seconds' exposure given,
taking especial care that no movement took place.</p>

<p>The plate being in due time carefully developed,
and as far as possible contrasts kept down, the result
proved satisfactory enough.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0140" id="p0140">140</a></span>

<p>It could more conveniently have been photographed,
of course, if a camera and tripod had been available,
but it is one of many such instances, where, when
shutter exposures only had been prepared for, occasions
arose, demanding longer exposures than were possible,
unless, some such temporary support be pressed into
use, as in this instance.</p>

<p>For successful work, see that the camera is simple,
its parts, of the best your pocket can afford. Give the
slowest exposures your subject will allow. Develop
for softly modelled negatives first, getting what density
is required afterwards. See that the camera is held
perfectly steady, during exposure, and don't forget it is
simply a camera, and lens, and will require <i>you
behind it</i>, just the same as any other employed with a
tripod, and in conclusion bear always in mind, <i>it is the
simplest form of camera work and the most difficult</i>, making
the utmost demands on your skill, if high-class results
are to be the outcome of its use.</p>

<p>A lantern Slide is
a transparent positive
on glass or other transparent
support, usually 3&frac14; inches
square, and is placed in the
lantern in such a way that
by suitable illumination and
optical arrangements the
image on the slide is made
to intercept some of the light
given off by the illuminant
from a screen, which without
the screen would be wholly
and evenly illuminated by
the light.</p>

<p>In viewing a paper print
we are really observing the
paper by reflected light, part
of our view being intercepted
by the image formed of pigment
or reduced metal; the
amount of light not being very great a very thin layer
of pigment is required to produce the appearance of
a sufficiently robust image. If the image alone or
with its vehicle be stripped from a good print on paper this<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0142" id="p0142">142</a></span>
image viewed by transmitted light will be found to be
extremely faint, far too faint to be of any use as a
"transparency," and also too thin to be of any use as a
lantern slide. On the other hand, what we know as a
"transparency," such as is often used for window
decoration, backed, perhaps, with ground glass, would
be found much too dense or robust for use as a lantern
slide. In density, then, a "slide," as it shall hereafter
be called, comes between the image on a paper print and
that on a "transparency." In "gradation," or gamut
of tones, the slide ought to be superior to either the
paper print with its almost absolute clearness over large
areas, or the transparency with its dense shadows and
its comparatively heavy lights. In fact, in a good slide
we have every grade of deposit from perfect transparency
to nearly complete opacity. But the extremes must be
very sparingly present, and the transition from one tone
to another must be gradual, all intermediate notes
between highest and lowest should be represented.</p>

<p>Other qualities go to make the perfect slide; the
metallic or other deposit forming the image must be in
the utmost degree fine, no approach to "grain" must be
perceptible even under the highest magnification. The
colour, or "tone," must be not only pleasant but
appropriate.</p>

<p>The loss of light in its journey from the illuminant
to our eyes is enormous; the disc on the screen is simply
a greatly magnified image of the light, and here is great
loss; add to this the interception of some light by the
opacity of the slide, and the fact that much more is lost
in reflection from the screen, and absorption by the
screen, and it is easy to realize that the image from the
screen reaching our eyes is vastly less bright than that
reaching the eye when, for instance, we examine a slide
in the hand by transmitted light. And loss of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0143" id="p0143">143</a></span>
means increase of contrast, so that a slide which would
seem about right in gradation in the hand would be
altogether soot-and-chalk as a screen-image. So too if
we have in the slide already shut out much light, by
making the slide foggy, or over dense, it is easy to see
that when the image reaches our eyes from the screen
this vicious opacity will be immensely increased in its
mischievous properties. The first style of slide gives
screen-images sometimes called "midsummer snow-scenes";
the other slide is simply called "foggy." Both
must be assiduously avoided.</p>

<p>It need hardly be said that the plates prepared by
some processes are more likely to yield good slides, such
as are described above, than plates prepared by other
processes; no one process can claim to possess in itself
superiority in all respects. Collodion, for instance, is
less apt to give foggy slides, and it is easier to intensify
than gelatine, but it is also more prone to give "hard"
images. Collodion is at its finest in the form of collodio-bromide
emulsion, which gives slides remarkable for
fineness of grain, for clearness, and for richness of tones;
but when we have to copy in the camera, the operation
with collodion emulsion is protracted, unless we have
bright daylight or a condensing arrangement, which with
large negatives is often out of the question. On the
whole it may be taken that gelatine-bromide emulsion is
the process to be recommended, not only on account of
its convenience and celerity, but in view of the many
inherent points of excellence that it possesses. In any
case, want of space will cause us to confine attention
here to that process, and any one mastering the use of
gelatine-bromide slide-plates will have nothing to fear
from competition with other processes in all-round work.
The writer has a leaning towards slide-plates as slow as
he can procure them, because slowness almost always<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0144" id="p0144">144</a></span>
goes hand in hand with fineness of grain and freedom
from fog.</p>

<p>There is one point of importance that should be
noted in working with gelatine for this purpose. Distilled
water should be used if possible for all solutions.
Tap water&mdash;especially hard water&mdash;is apt to produce
with the gelatine a certain amount of scum which, if
present in any appreciable degree, cannot fail to affect
the quality of the slides; but treatment with an acid
alum bath as described later has a very salutary effect
in removing any scum that may have formed during the
"liquid" operations.</p>

<p>In the mechanics of making a slide from a
negative we have only two methods to consider.
If the slide-image is to be the same size as the
negative, or a part of the negative, we print by <i>contact</i>,
that is, we put the negative and the slide-plate face to
face in contact, and we expose to light, the negative
being next to the light; this corresponds with making a
print on paper. But when we desire to make a slide
including all the subject of a negative larger than a slide-plate,
or, in fact, when we desire to alter the size of the
image at all, we copy the negative "in the camera."
The simplest method of doing this is to fix up the negative
so that it is evenly lighted and make a photograph
of it in a camera; but the adjustments necessary for
such an operation would be found awkward, and so a
"reducing camera" of some kind is generally used.
Many such cameras are on the market, and consist of
devices for holding the negative in a suitable position
with regard to a small camera furnished with a lens and
a dark slide holding a lantern plate. Either the negative-holder
or the camera should have possible movement
in all directions vertical to the optical axis of the
whole, and in addition it is often desirable to have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0145" id="p0145">145</a></span>
certain amount of movement in other planes, in order to
correct certain optical defects that are sometimes found
in negatives. The writer has for many years used a
small camera with its front stuck into the front of a
large camera, one or other of these cameras has every
necessary movement. The device is figured here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Camera and Negative Holder">
	<a name="cp0145" id="cp0145" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0145-400.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Camera and Negative Holder" />
</div>

<p>Whatever arrangement is used the end of the
apparatus bearing the negative is directed towards a
good and even light; and it is well to place about two
inches in front of the negative towards the light a piece
of finely ground glass for ordinary negatives; this glass
is with advantage omitted with extra dense negatives.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the exposure, whether
we are working by contact or in the camera is of the
utmost importance; but it is not possible in an article
such as this to give even an approximate idea of the
exposure suitable under any concatenation of conditions.
The best clue to exposure is to be found in
development, and in results. It is necessary to know
what happens after normal exposure with a given
developer, and then if any variation is noticed to alter
the exposure. If a plate develops more rapidly than the
normal, it may fairly be deduced that the exposure has
been too long; but if we are dealing with a specially
contrasted negative it is better so. On the other hand,
when we are dealing with a thin negative, especially if
the scale of gradation is short, we require an exposure
less than what would under normal conditions lead to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0146" id="p0146">146</a></span>
complete development in the normal time. And again
some plates require to be developed to a greater point
of apparent density than others; this is a matter of
experience. Briefly put, there is no royal road to good
slide-making, experience is necessary.</p>

<p>In actually making the exposures certain points
must be kept in mind. If we are copying in the camera
with daylight as illuminant it is very important to use
the light from the north; if we use other light we shall
be much put out on most occasions by awkward variations
of the brightness. A very large number of operations
are rendered nugatory by carelessness in this
matter. Even the most experienced worker will find it
impossible to expose plates with anything like accuracy
when he has to deal with direct sunshine at one time,
thin white clouds at another, and dark clouds at a third.
And in making exposures by contact the beginner must
be fairly accurate in judging the time of exposure and
the distance from the radiant. A good plan is to tie to
the gas jet a piece of cord having knots at convenient
intervals, such as at 9, 12, 18 and 24 inches, and in
making an exposure to use these knots as guides to the
distance; moreover, the law of "squares of distance"
must be remembered; the intensity of light varies
inversely as the square of distance from radiant to
receiver, provided, of course, no optical arrangement is
introduced to modify the path of the rays. Consequently,
for example, if ten seconds is found to be a
proper exposure at nine inches from the light, the
corresponding exposure at eighteen inches will not be
twenty, but forty seconds (9<sup>2</sup>=81. 18<sup>2</sup>=324). And as
it is sometimes awkward to hold the frame and attend
to a watch at the same time, a metronome, ticking
seconds, will be found convenient, or a clock with a
second hand may be placed where it can be seen during<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0147" id="p0147">147</a></span>
the exposure. A landscape slide without clouds, if the
horizon is in the picture, is usually considered a failure,
and has been dubbed "bald-headed." Really good
workers often put clouds into slides by "combination
printing," which in some cases is comparatively easy,
in others very difficult. If we are working by reduction
from a good-sized negative, with a fairly even horizon,
the difficulty is not great. The landscape part of the
negative is first exposed, the sky being masked if necessary,
and a cloud negative is then substituted for the
landscape negative, a part of the former being masked
to correspond with the landscape on the latter, and a
second exposure is made on the same slide-plate.
Admittedly in all cases this requires "some doing," in
many cases it is extremely difficult. An easier, if less
"sportsmanlike," method is to make the cloud slide on
a separate slide-plate, and to use the latter as a "cover-glass"
for the slide. The cloud may cover the whole of
the second slide, and that part of it not required may be
wiped out by means of a reducing solution, used with
a brush, such as the ferricyanide and hypo one described
later. This method will be found useful even in contact
slide making, but it also requires not only good taste in
the selection of the cloud, but some deftness in manipulation;
but the neat-handed beginner need not fear
to make the attempt.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that judgment of exposure
is a matter of experience, and that results are the
best criterion; here follow some more explicit statements
on the same matter.</p>

<p>Whatever plate or developer is used, and whatever
the time occupied in complete development:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>1st.</i>&mdash;If by the time the high-lights are sufficiently
strong the shadows are too dense or blocked, the
plate has been under-exposed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0148" id="p0148">148</a></span>

<p><i>2nd.</i>&mdash;If by the time the high-lights are sufficiently
strong the shadows have not attained sufficient
density, or are veiled, the plate has been over-exposed.</p>

<p><i>3rd.</i>&mdash;If at the same moment the high-lights show
sufficiently and the shadows are transparent but
sufficiently plucky, the plate has been properly
exposed.</p>

<p><i>4th.</i>&mdash;With a normal negative the normal exposure is
the proper exposure; but (<i>a</i>) a negative abnormally
strong in contrasts will require an abnormally
long exposure; and (<i>b</i>) a thin negative, or one
with a very short scale of gradation from densest
to clearest, will require an abnormally short
exposure, with probably some after-treatment in
the direction of "intensification."</p></div>

<p>Ambitious slide-makers generally aim at warm-toned
slides for pictorial effect, and rightly. But
slides intended for scientific purposes are generally
better when cold in tone, the definition is usually better.
But whatever the aim, a good tone of one kind is preferable
to a poor one of another kind, and the beginner
should first make sure of getting a really good cold tone,
which is comparatively easy, and then try his "'prentice
hand" on warm tones.</p>

<p>Warm tones are obtained by using greatly super-normal
exposures and greatly restrained developers;
and the danger probably lies in the fact that the long
exposures are apt to lead to fog, and the great restraint
to over-density in the shadows, the latter especially
when the exposure has not been quite long enough for
the developer used; herein probably lies the whole
secret of warm slide-making. If we aim at really warm
tones and use developers suited to such design, we must
on no account stint the exposure.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0149" id="p0149">149</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">COLD TONE DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS.</p>

<p>The classical solution for cold tone slides is a solution
of ferrous oxalate in potassic oxalate. Of all developers
it is most free from fogging propensities. It is made
from so-called "saturated solutions" of proto-sulphate of
iron and potassium oxalate. Thus, into a bottle put a
quantity of iron proto-sulphate, and pour on about three
times its weight of water containing a dram of sulphuric
acid to each pint. Shake well, and keep always at about
60° Fahr.; some of the iron must always be visible in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0150" id="p0150">150</a></span>
bottle, if not, more is to be added. The crystals of iron
salt must be green and not rusty in colour. This is the
"iron solution."</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Untitled Illustration">
	<a name="cp0149" id="cp0149" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0149-400.jpg" width="367" height="400" alt="Untitled Illustration" />
</div>

<p>The "oxalate solution" is made by dissolving
potassium oxalate in about three times its weight of
water. This also must be kept at 60° Fahr., shaken
occasionally, and oxalate added if none is visible in the
bottle.</p>

<p>To make the ferrous oxalate solution we <i>pour</i> one
part of the iron solution <i>into</i> six parts of the oxalate, and
it is advisable to add to each ounce of developer at least
half a grain of potassium bromide; 5 minims of a 10%
solution, made by dissolving one ounce of the bromide in
about 9 ounces of water, and then making up to 10
ounces&mdash;all chemical.</p>

<p>In about four minutes or less this ought to fully
develop a properly exposed plate. If the development is
much shorter the slide is apt to have an unpleasant
greenish tone, a result that may also follow the use of an
inordinate amount of bromide in the developer. The
developing solution may be made in quantity greater
than is required for one plate, and may be used several
times if a little of the surplus and fresh solution is added
when the quantity in use becomes slow in action.</p>

<p>For really fine cold black tones the following
formula by <span class="smcap">Messrs. Elliott &amp; Son</span> will be found
admirable:&mdash;</p>

<p>The developing solution consists of equal parts of A
and B.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0151" id="p0151">151</a></span>

<p>If either of the above developers is to be used, the
exposure is to be kept down as compared with the
exposure to be followed by developers intended for very
warm tones.</p>

<p>The two developers which follow next, require
about the same exposure as the two already formulated.
"Ortol" is a reducing agent quite lately introduced by
Mr. Hauff, of Feuerbach in Germany, and Mr. Hauff's
agents in this country are Messrs. Fuerst Bros., of
London. "Ortol" gives the finest tones of the warm
black type that we have as yet come across, it is
singularly free from fogging propensity, and the tones do
not easily degenerate into the greens so apt to occur
after severe over-exposure with other "black" developers.
We suggest a simple formula:&mdash;</p>

<p>To make the developer, take one part of A, one of B,
and one of water, and to each ounce of the mixture add
one and a half or two grains of potassium bromide. The
development of a properly exposed slide will take two or
three minutes, and the result will probably be highly
appreciated.</p>

developers for warm black tones, but the following

<p>The developing solution consists of equal parts of A
and B, and the plate may be fully developed in about
two to three minutes.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that in order to obtain
really warm red or reddish tones by development, it is
necessary to give very long exposure, and to use a
developer very much restrained. It is further found
that carbonate of ammonia has a considerable effect in
reddening the developed image, and so we now come to
procedure based on these lines. Carbonate of ammonia
is found in commerce in the shape of "chunks" more or
less square. If one of these is pared with a knife&mdash;unless
the sample is quite fresh&mdash;the outside will be found to
be a soft amorphous powder, the inside a clear, very hard
crystal; the clear crystal is in development an
"accelerator," though a very weak one, the outside
substance is a restrainer. Probably both the inside&mdash;sesquicarbonate&mdash;and
the outside&mdash;bicarbonate&mdash;are useful,
and the best plan is to make a ten per cent. solution
of the substance as obtained from a good chemist&mdash;not
druggist. Of this solution one grain of the salt is
represented by ten minims. If now we take an ounce of
A, and one of B of the last formula, and if we add to the
ounce of A 3 grains of ammonium bromide, and to the
ounce of B 3 grains of ammonium carbonate, and if we
have given a proper exposure and develop with equal
parts of the A and B modified as above, we shall get a
slide of rich chocolate colour; and if we double the
proportions of carbonate and bromide, and expose still
longer, we shall get a slide still ruddier in tone, even
to red. But there is always danger of fog, and of
clogged shadows, and this must be reckoned with.
There is a more certain and less dangerous way of
getting handsome tones, which shall be described
presently.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0153" id="p0153">153</a></span>

<p>Gelatine slides are always fixed in hyposulphite of
soda, about one part by weight to six parts of water;
after this they must be well washed, say five minutes
under a good rose tap, or in many changes of water in a
dish for an hour, and every slide should be treated with
a saturated solution of potash alum, of which each pint
should contain a dram of hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>Very many, if not most, slides are all the better for
just a touch of a "reducer" such as follows:&mdash;The
ordinary "hypo." solution is weakened with about four
times its measure of water, and the plate is soaked for
a minute in this. A few drops of a ten per cent. solution
of potassium ferricyanide are put into the measure, and
the hypo. mixed with it, and the whole allowed to work
on the plate for a short time, carefully watched. Of course
a weak slide must not be thus treated, but it is often a
good plan to develop slides to such a point that they will
permit of this treatment.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is often advisable to keep a
slide thin in development, for instance, when the negative
wants pluck, and intensification is indicated; or when
we wish a good warm tone after a "black" developer
such as our metol formula: a good average treatment
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take half an ounce each of ammonium chloride and
mercury bichloride and dissolve in 16 ounces of water,
soak the slide in this till it is bleached. Wash well and
treat with weak liquid ammonia, or a solution of soda
sulphite, or of metabisulphite of potash, or fresh lime
water. This will strengthen the slide and give it in most
cases a fine rich colour. It is important to let these
solutions act thoroughly, and not to stop the action half-way.
The writer considers this the best and safest way to
obtain warm tones, the reader may find out for himself which
of these solutions produces the tones he chiefly affects.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0154" id="p0154">154</a></span>

<p>Crystal varnish is <i>not</i> wasted even on a gelatine
slide.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it must be realized that the screen-image
is a greatly enlarged edition of the slide-image;
any small defect on the slide is a huge one on the screen.
Consequently the slide-maker must sedulously cultivate
cleanliness and manipulative care.</p>

<p>Enlargements
may be made by daylight,
or by artificial light,
and there are two methods
of producing them, namely,
by enlarging direct from the
negative on to a sheet of
bromide paper; or by first
making a small transparency,
and from that producing an
enlarged negative upon a
slow dry plate. The first is
the method usually adopted
by amateurs, probably because
the necessary operations
are fewer, and perhaps
more simple. The second
plan, however, possesses the
advantage that the prints
may be made by any process,
be it carbon, platinum, or
silver, and thus a great variety of effect obtained.</p>

<p>The first point however that the reader must decide
is whether he will work by artificial light or by daylight.
Each may be said to possess certain advantages, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0156" id="p0156">156</a></span>
with many the question resolves itself into one of
personal convenience. Artificial light is, or should be,
fairly constant in intensity, and if adopted there will
probably be less waste of material through miscalculation
of exposure. But if the source of light employed
be other than a mixed jet, or the arc-light, if in fact it
be of low intensity, negatives of a somewhat delicate
type will be required in order to produce enlargements
of the highest excellence. If the negatives are dense
and strong, illuminants of low intensity, like oil or gas,
do not possess sufficient penetration to duly register the
denser portions of the negative, and the enlargements
so made are apt to be deficient in half-tone, and hard.
With well-graded negatives of suitable quality, however,
most excellent enlargements may be produced by
artificial light. When artificial light is used work may
be carried on at any time of day or night, in winter or
summer. Those who adopt the daylight plan will, of
course, be subjected to greater restrictions, at any rate,
during the winter months, but amateurs who take a real
interest in the work will do well to adopt the writer's
plan, and provide themselves with apparatus for each
method of working.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">ENLARGING BY DAYLIGHT.</p>

<p>There are two ways of enlarging by daylight. The
first involves the exclusion of all actinic light from a
room except that which passes through the negative.
The alternative method of working is to employ an
ordinary enlarging camera, such as are made by
Middlemiss, or Lancaster. It is desirable, but not
necessary, if the first plan be adopted, to secure the
exclusive use of a room. One with a northerly aspect
should be chosen, for if sunlight falls upon the window
shadows will at some period of the day fall upon the
negative, and produce unevenly lighted enlargements.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0157" id="p0157">157</a></span>
An upper room will be most suitable, and, if the
light be a northern one, and there are no trees
or buildings to obstruct the view, a reflector
may be dispensed with. If external objects intervene,
however, one must be employed. It should be fixed
outside the window-sill, at an angle of 45°, and should
be capable of adjustment. Let it be <i>the full width of the
window</i>, and <i>securely fixed</i> for obvious reasons. A plate-glass
mirror is effective, but expensive. A large
drawing board painted dead white also answers well,
but should not be left outside exposed to the weather.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 1 and side view ditto">
	<a name="cp0157" id="cp0157" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0157-400.png" width="400" height="317" alt="fig 1 and side view ditto." />
	<br />
	<span class="caption">
		<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Fig. 1.<span style="margin-left: 17em;">Side View Ditto.</span></span>
	</span>
</div>

<p>Provision for excluding the light from the room is
best secured by making a wooden frame large enough
to fit closely against the window frame. Upon this a
piece of stout calico should be tightly strained and
secured with tacks. It should then be sized, and when
dry will be as tight as a drum; it must then be covered
with two thicknesses of stout brown paper pasted on.
The frame is shown complete in Fig. 1. Now at A.A.
B.B. screw two strips of wood, the distance apart must
be regulated by the size of the negatives to be enlarged.
The ordinary camera is intended to be used as the
enlarging camera, and the distance from C. to C. should<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0158" id="p0158">158</a></span>
be just equal to the size of the back portion of the
camera. On the lower rail BB screw a piece of 9 in.
board to form a shelf or support D. for the enlarging
camera. Make a frame E. of &frac12; in. wood 1 in. deep,
the same size as the back of the camera, and screw to
the shelf and top rail AA. Now carefully cut away
the brown paper and calico from the inside of this
frame, at the part marked H. and paste strips of brown
paper round it so as to prevent any light passing except
through the opening H. A strip of felt should be
tacked all round the large frame to prevent any light from
creeping in between it and the window frame. A couple
of turn buttons will keep it in position. A <i>firm</i> table
should be placed against the window close up to the
wall to form a support for the enlarging easel. Now
a little care must be taken in fitting up this portion
of the apparatus, and it is better to have something
more exact than the propped-up drawing board or
printing frame, which is sometimes recommended. Get
a carpenter to run out two V shaped rails as shown in
Fig. 2 at CC. They should be about the length of the
table, and screwed down upon it. Procure a cheap<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0159" id="p0159">159</a></span>
drawing board about 15 x 12, and to the under side
affix two pieces of wood with V shaped grooves corresponding
in angle to the rails. This forms the base of
the easel AA. Make a frame 22 x 20, or rather larger
than the biggest enlargement that it is desired to produce.
It should be constructed of ½ in. wood, and be 2 in. deep.
It is shown in Fig. 2 at 1 DDDD. Now make, or get
made, a set of carriers EE, the largest of which should
just fit into the frame. Narrow fillets of wood screwed
each side will afford a rise and fall adjustment, and a
thumb screw at G will fix the carrier in any desired
position. To obtain the cross-movement screw the
frame DDDD to a piece of inch board 5 in. wide HH.
Place this exactly in the centre of the base board, and
screw fillets II of 1 in. wood to each side. This will
afford a cross motion, and a thumb screw at J will fix
the carrier frame when the necessary adjustment has
been made.</p>

</div>

<p>In setting up an enlarging apparatus, whether it be
for day or artificial light, it is absolutely essential to
preserve the parallelism of its various parts, otherwise
it will be impossible to produce sharp or evenly defined
enlargements, and for this reason I have described somewhat
fully the construction of a suitable easel. I may
add that it will serve equally well for either daylight or
artificial illumination, and I strongly advise the reader
to construct, or have constructed, an easel on the lines I
have laid down. With it either direct enlargements on
paper can be produced, or plates may be used and
enlarged negatives made. The easiest way of holding
the paper during exposure is to procure two sheets of
clear glass, patent plate is most suitable, sandwich the
bromide paper between them, and secure with two
strong bands of elastic. The complete apparatus in
position for working is shown at Fig. 3.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0160" id="p0160">160</a></span>

	<span class="caption">Fig. 3.</span>
</div>

<p>The second method of enlarging by daylight is by
employing an ordinary enlarging camera. The same
conditions as to lighting, etc., should be sought for, and
the most convenient way of working will be to tilt the
camera at such an angle as that the negative receives
unobstructed illumination from the sky. A reflector in
this case will not be necessary, but a piece of very finely
ground glass should be placed about an inch in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0161" id="p0161">161</a></span>
the negative in order to soften and diffuse the light.
This method of working is shown in Fig. 4.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">ENLARGING BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT.</span></p>

<p>Before describing the actual process of making an
enlargement it will be well to deal with the alternative
method of working, namely, by artificial light, as the
manipulations of the sensitive material used are the
same in either case. Practically the most satisfactory
way of working by the latter method is to use
an enlarging lantern properly fitted with a condenser.
The general principles of such an
apparatus are identical with those which obtain
in an ordinary optical lantern. Methods which dispense
with the use of a condenser are more or less unsatisfactory,
and should be avoided. In the space at the
disposal of the writer it is not possible to give directions

<p>Enlarging lanterns of excellent quality are obtainable
commercially, but for the guidance of the uninitiated
it may be useful to refer a little in detail to one or
two important points with regard to their construction.
The condenser will first claim attention. The
ordinary pattern consists of two plano-convex lenses
mounted as shown in section at Fig. 5. This answers
fairly well with the smaller sizes, but when the diameter<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0162" id="p0162">162</a></span>
of the condenser is large, a good deal of light may be
lost. The interposition of a small meniscus or plano-convex
lens, in the manner first suggested by the late
J. Traill Taylor, and shown in Fig. 6, will be found a
great improvement. Its proper position will be at the
point where the divergent cone of rays proceeding from
it just covers the large condenser. In our own practice
we always place a diffusing screen of very finely-ground glass
in front of the condenser at E.E. The diameter
of the condenser is governed by the size of the negatives
to be enlarged, it must be of sufficient size to include
the longer sides of the plate within its circumference
without cutting the corners. If it is much larger than
this, an unnecessary loss of light will occur, because only
that which passes through the negative can be utilized.</p>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 6.</span>
</div>
<br />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">THE ILLUMINANT.</span></p>

<p>The smaller and more intense the light, the nearer
we approach to the ideal projection illuminant, and the
better will be the definition of our enlargements. The
arc light most nearly fulfils the desired conditions, and
if it be available it should certainly be employed. Next
in point of utility comes the limelight, preferably in the
form of the mixed jet, and those who understand its
manipulation are recommended to adopt it, but the
majority of amateurs will probably find it more convenient
to use either incandescent gaslight or an
oil-lamp. Parallel wick-lamps should be avoided<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0163" id="p0163">163</a></span>
on account of the unequal illumination they produce,
and if oil must be used a good circular wick
burner will be found more suitable. Where house-gas
is available the incandescent gaslight is however
much to be preferred. The light is perhaps not so
powerful as that given by a really good parallel wick-lamp,
but it is far more actinic and penetrating. The
writer has used this light with great satisfaction, and
therefore has no hesitation in recommending it. Some
workers have been troubled by the appearance of an
image of the mantle on the screen, but this can usually
be got rid of by a suitable adjustment of the lenses and
the light, and in any case by the interposition of a piece
of ground glass between condenser and negative.</p>

<br />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">THE CHOICE OF THE LENS.</span></p>

<p>It is commonly stated that the lens with which the
original negative was taken will serve equally well to
enlarge it, and in the abstract the statement is perhaps
not inaccurate. But assuming that a lens of a focus equal
to about 1&frac14; times the base of the plate has been used,
it will be found that better results, both in regard
to definition and equality of illumination, will be
obtained by substituting a lens of rather longer focus,
for example a half-plate lens for enlarging from quarter-plate
negatives. This, although applying to both
methods of working is particularly desirable when
enlarging by artificial light, for an objective of small
diameter and short focus cannot possibly pick up or
receive the whole of the cone of rays proceeding from
the condenser. A reference to Figs. 7 and 8 will explain
why this is so. In Fig. 7 we see what happens when a
lens of too short a focus is used, but when one of longer
focus is substituted, the whole of the cone of rays passes
through and is utilized (Fig. 8). In selecting a lens one<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0164" id="p0164">164</a></span>
should be chosen which has a sufficiently large diameter to
permit the apex of the cone of rays from the condenser to
pass through. This point will, of course, vary with the
degree of amplification, and in order to obtain the best
results optically, the distance of the light from the
condenser must be carefully adjusted in every case, and
a clear, evenly lighted disc obtained before inserting the
negative to be enlarged.</p>

<p>With regard to the type of lens, one of the rapid
rectilinear form will answer well. A portrait lens is
often used on account of the brilliancy of image, but
although it answers well for enlarging portraits, the
roundness of its field makes it less suitable for landscapes
unless it is considerably stopped down. If the
very finest results as regards definition are required,
then one of the now numerous flat-field lenses should be
used. The writer can from practical experience speak
well of the Ross-Goerz and the Cooke lens. The latter
is perhaps preferable for working with artificial light on
account of the larger diameter of the back lens. Wide-angle
lenses, on account of their small aperture and
short focus, are not suitable for use with a condenser,
both for the reasons given, and on account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0165" id="p0165">165</a></span>
difficulty in focussing owing to the small amount of
light transmitted. When daylight is used, however,
there is less objection to their employment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 9.">
	<a name="cp0165" id="cp0165" ></a>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 9.</span>
</div>

<p>Before leaving this part of the subject it should be
noted that in regard to preserving the parallelism of
its parts the same care in erecting and fitting up the
enlarging lantern must be observed, as was insisted upon
in the description of the apparatus for daylight. It will
be found convenient, therefore, to mount the lantern on a
base similar to that upon which the easel rests, so that
both may move on the same rails. The easel described
for daylight enlarging will serve equally well for
working by artificial light. The complete apparatus is
shown at Fig. 9, which is a reproduction from a
photograph of the apparatus constructed and used by
the writer.</p>

<br />
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">THE NEGATIVE.</span></p>

<p>In general practice one may find it necessary at
times to enlarge from negatives of very dissimilar types,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0166" id="p0166">166</a></span>
but there is no reason, when the negatives are to be
produced with the special object of subsequently
making enlargements from them, why care should not
be taken to make them of a suitable character. Thin
delicate negatives should be enlarged by artificial light;
dense, strong ones by daylight. If the negatives are
very strong it will be difficult to produce soft and well-graded
enlargements with a weak illuminant, the light
not being sufficiently intense to properly penetrate the
high-lights. A soft and clear negative, with good gradation,
fully exposed, and neither exhibiting patches of
clear glass shadow devoid of detail, nor of hard impenetrable
high-light, will be found most suitable. Fog
should be avoided, as also should the yellow stain
produced by pyro when improperly used. Not that the
pyro developer is unsuitable, for if sufficient sulphite is
used, and the quantity of pyro kept down, negatives of
very beautiful quality for enlarging purposes may be
produced. Great care should be taken to avoid bubbles,
stains, scratches, or any kind of mechanical defects, as such
when enlarged become painfully obtrusive, and spoil the
effect of the best work. It will be found a good plan to
bind the edge of the negative before enlarging it with a
strip of lantern slide binding, so as to cover the clear
glass rebate mark. If this be omitted the margins of the
enlargement may become fogged by the lateral spreading
action of the light. No hand-work should be attempted
on the original negative, for any such treatment will
become painfully apparent in the enlargement. If retouching
be deemed necessary, it should in the case
of a direct enlargement be executed upon the print itself,
or upon the enlarged negative or preferably upon the
enlarged transparency, when that method of reproduction
has been adopted.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0167" id="p0167">167</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">DIRECT ENLARGEMENTS.</p>

<p>The following concise instructions for enlarging
upon bromide paper will apply equally to the daylight
or artificial light methods of working. In the first case
the negative is placed in the dark slide of the camera, both
shutters being drawn fully out. The camera is then put
upon the shelf close up against the opening in the shutter,
as shown in Fig. 3, any light creeping in between shutter
and camera being blocked out with the focussing cloth.
If the enlarging lantern is used the negative will be
placed in the carrier, just in the same way as a lantern
slide, with the film side towards the enlarging lens.
Now the first difficulty that will be experienced will be
to get the enlarged image of the required size. It will
be well to content ourselves at the outset with a
moderate degree of enlargement, say from &frac14; plate to
12 × 10, and when proficiency is acquired, larger sizes
can be attempted. At first we shall probably not
succeed in getting any image at all. In adjusting the
various parts of the apparatus we shall find the work
easier if we remember that the nearer we place the lens
to the negative the further will it be necessary to move
the easel from the lens, and the greater will be the
enlargement. A useful table of enlargements will be
found in the "British Journal Almanac," showing the
distance of lens from negative, and negative from paper,
for almost any required degree of amplification.</p>

<p>Now it will be found much easier to focus the
enlarged image by looking at it through a piece of finely
ground glass, than by receiving it on a piece of card or
paper, and the adoption of the easel plan of focussing
previously described will enable this to be done. The
ground surface of the glass (which must be of the same
thickness as the piece behind which the paper is to be
exposed) should be away from the lens and towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0168" id="p0168">168</a></span>
person focussing, when it is placed in the carrier of the
easel, it being retained in position with the spring S.,
Fig. 2. Focussing must be carefully performed, and
is effected by sliding the easel to and fro upon the
runners, and which should have been previously rubbed
with blacklead.</p>

<p>Bromide paper is made in several varieties, such as
smooth, rough, snow-enamel, cream crayon, etc., and is
put up either in tubes, or packed flat. The latter is
decidedly the more convenient, it being somewhat difficult
to take the curl out of paper that has been rolled. The
choice of paper is a matter of taste; for landscape work
the rough paper or the cream crayon will perhaps be found
most suitable. For finer work, and some classes of portraiture
the enamel will prove effective. Rough paper is
better for strong broad effects, smooth for more delicate
work and the rendering of fine detail. The coated side
may be distinguished by its tendency to curl inwards.
The easiest way of exposing it is to procure two pieces
of patent plate glass of the same thickness as the
focussing glass, sandwich the sheet of paper between
the two, and secure with strong elastic bands. This
will hold it quite flat during exposure, and will not
disturb the actinism of the lens or impair the definition
of the enlargement.</p>

<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>This part of the work of producing an enlargement
will only be lightly dealt with, as the subject is
fully treated elsewhere in this volume. The writer
prefers the ferrous-oxalate developer for bromide
enlargements to any of the more recently introduced
developers, but as it requires more skill and judgment
to employ it with complete success, beginners may find
it better to use amidol or metol, either of which when<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0169" id="p0169">169</a></span>
properly used gives excellent results. Hydrokinone we
do not recommend for this purpose owing to its tendency
to give rusty blacks in the event of over-exposure, or
undue hardness if it has been too short. With amidol
a pure delicate black is easily obtainable, and it is
moreover a very simple developer to use. Our own
plan is to employ a weak solution and give a full
exposure, and by these means we find no difficulty in
obtaining good gradation and pure blacks. The dish
used for development must not be used for other developers
or stains will probably occur. Although a quick
appearance of the image is usually a characteristic of
amidol, no trouble will be experienced when the developer
is used in the way we advise, for the picture will
be found to develop slowly and regularly, and gradually
grow in strength. Quick development by this method
would be an indication of over-exposure. A correctly
exposed enlargement should take about ten minutes to
develop. One stock solution only is necessary. It
will keep indefinitely.</p>

		<td class="tdl">grains.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>To each ounce of the above add, just before using, three
grains of dry amidol. The exposure must be accurately
timed. It is, however, impossible to give useful
information on this head, unless such varying factors as
the rapidity of the paper, the intensity of the light, the
aperture of the lens, and the degree of enlargement are
known. The best plan is to cut one of the sheets
of bromide paper into twelve strips, and on these
make several test exposures, carefully noting the
duration of each. It is better (at any rate for a beginner)
not to vary the constituents or strength of the developer,
but to increase or diminish the exposure until a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0170" id="p0170">170</a></span>
result in colour and tonality is obtained. By entering
full details relating to the production of a successful
enlargement in a notebook, great exactitude in working
will be obtained, and there need be little or no waste of
material when additional enlargements have to be made
from the same negatives at a future time.</p>

<p>A glass dish, though expensive, is very suitable for
developing, for being flat-bottomed a minimum of
solution can be used, and moreover if the dish should be
dirty, the fact is at once apparent. The exposed paper
should be soaked in water for a few minutes until
uniformly wetted, and any air-bells removed with a
camel-hair brush. The water is then poured off, and
the developer applied in an even wave, so that the whole
of the paper is covered uniformly and quickly. The
image will appear slowly, and gradually gain in detail.
When all the detail has appeared it may still appear
lacking in vigour and contrast, but this will come if
sufficient time be allowed. <i>Development should not be
stopped until the print is of the full strength required</i>, but it is
not advisable to allow it to become much darker than it
is desired to appear when finished, because there is very
little loss of strength in the fixing bath.</p>

<p>If the image flashes out immediately upon the
application of the developer, the paper has been over-exposed.
A strong dose (one or two drams) of ten per
cent. bromide added to the developer may help to
save it, but the enlargement will probably look poor
and flat and of bad colour when finished. If the
picture appears very slowly, and refuses to gain in
strength, under-exposure is the cause, and two or three
drams of a ten per cent. solution of sulphite of soda may
improve matters, but as a rule the most satisfactory
plan will be to make another exposure. With regard to
the strength of the developer, that given is very suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0171" id="p0171">171</a></span>
for negatives of normal density, but some papers may
require a little more amidol, the appearance of the finished
enlargements will guide the reader in regulating the
quantity to suit the particular paper with which he may
be working. The enlargement should be washed in
plenty of running water from the tap to arrest development,
and then fixed in:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Hyposulphite of soda</td>
		<td class="tdr">4</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">20</td>
		<td class="tdc">"</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>A quarter of an hour should be allowed for fixation, but
it is better to use two baths, giving ten minutes in each.
After washing in running water for a couple of hours
they may be hung up by one corner to dry, or pinned
down to a blotting board.</p>

<p>Enlargements produced in the manner described
should be of a pure engraving black colour, and if they
are mounted upon <i>pure</i> boards with <i>freshly</i> made Glenfield
starch, they should prove permanent. Enlargements
are frequently toned to various shades of brown
and red, generally by the employment of the uranium-toning
bath. Although the colours so obtained are
often very artistic and pleasing, no reliance can be placed
upon the permanence of an enlargement so treated, and
the writer strongly recommends that when warm coloured
prints are desired, an enlarged negative should be made
and prints made therefrom in carbon, silver, or sepia
platinotype.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">ENLARGED NEGATIVES.</p>

<p>The production of an enlarged negative presents no
difficulty that need deter any careful worker from
attempting the work. No additional apparatus to that
already described will be required, and either day or
artificial light may be employed. In the first place a<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0172" id="p0172">172</a></span>
transparency must be made from the small original
negative. It may be made either by contact or in the
camera, preferably the latter as then the acme of
sharpness will be obtained. If, however, the reader is
acquainted with the carbon process he cannot do better
than make a carbon transparency, for such are specially
adapted for the production of enlarged negatives.
Many, however, will prefer to make the transparency on
a bromide plate, and as this is the part of the process
which requires the greatest amount of care, and as <i>in
fact</i> the <i>quality of the enlarged negative will entirely depend
upon the character of the small transparency</i>, it is necessary
to deal with the matter somewhat in detail. Preconceived
ideas of quality based upon the appearance of a
good lantern slide must be put aside, for that is not at
all what is required. What is wanted is a transparency
in which every possible detail existing in the negative
has been reproduced, and which in comparison with a
lantern slide would look rather flat and over-exposed.
Every possible precaution should be taken to avoid
granularity or coarseness of image, therefore a slow
plate is almost essential; plates coated with lantern-slide
emulsion are now obtainable, and will be found
very suitable. A full exposure should be given, and a
weak and well-restrained developer employed. These
conditions tend to the production of the qualities desired.
Warm coloured transparencies so produced generally
have a finer grain than those developed to a black
or colder colour, but unless the colours produced
are fairly uniform, considerable variation in exposure
when making the enlarged negatives will be necessary,
and for this reason it would perhaps be better
for the beginner to aim at the production of good
black transparencies possessing the qualities indicated.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0173" id="p0173">173</a></span>

<p>The small transparency, having been fixed, washed
and dried, should be edged with black paper to prevent
any subsequent fogging of the plate, by the lateral
spreading action of the light. It is then placed in the
enlarging apparatus, just as in the case of a negative,
and carefully focussed. This operation must be very
carefully performed. The writer uses a thin and very
sharp negative of an architectural subject to focus with,
afterwards substituting the transparency which is to be
enlarged. Landscape subjects, consisting chiefly of
foliage, are seldom critically sharp, and it is then difficult to
secure a sharply-focussed enlargement. The remainder of
the operation is extremely simple. In the place of the
ground-glass screen (which in this case should have its
rough or ground side nearest to the enlarging lens) a
slow dry plate is placed, backed with a piece of cardboard
covered with black velvet to avoid reflections and
possible fog. The exposure should be full, and a weak
developer employed. Trial exposures may be made on
quarter-plates, coated from the same batch of emulsion,
which the manufacturers will willingly supply, if the
purpose for which they are required is made known.
Pyro will be found the most suitable developer, but it
should contain a full proportion of sulphite, and not be
too strong. Exposure and development should be
so adjusted that by the time every possible detail has
been developed up, the plate will not have become
unduly dense. If expense has to be considered, a
piece of slow smooth bromide paper may be substituted
for the large dry plate in which case the result will be
an enlarged paper negative. For large sizes, 15 × 12
and beyond, the latter is a very economical method of
working, and the negatives will be found to yield most
artistic prints, and if the operations have been carried
out as described, and the prescribed conditions carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0174" id="p0174">174</a></span>
observed, the grain of the paper will not show obtrusively
or unpleasantly in the prints.</p>

<p>An alternative method of working, and one which
admits of a large amount of control over the ultimate
result, is to make in the first place a large transparency
of the full size that the enlarged negative is desired to
be. All the precautions upon which stress has been laid
should be observed in regard to the choice of plate,
developer, etc.; but in this case the enlarged transparency
may be given a little more vigour and sparkle
than would be desirable if the other method of
reproduction were adopted, though in this the reader
must be guided by the particular effect which he may
be seeking to produce in his prints. For this purpose
pyro will be found to be the most suitable developer,
in that it permits of a large amount of control. From
the large transparency a negative is produced by
contact printing either upon a plate, or upon a piece of
bromide paper.</p>

<p>The great advantages of the latter mode of working
are the facilities which are afforded for retouching or
working upon the large transparency. Negative retouching
is always a difficult operation to an amateur,
for he cannot see the effect of his work until he has
made a print; whereas, in retouching a transparency
the effect produced by each stroke of the pencil or brush
is at once apparent. In the space at disposal it is not
possible to describe the various ways in which improvements
can be effected. First there are the chemical
aids of local intensification or reduction. Then much
may be done by the judicious use of a pencil, but the
part to be retouched must first be lightly rubbed with a
little retouching medium in order to make the pencil
bite. In extreme cases the back of the negative may<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0175" id="p0175">175</a></span>
be covered with tissue paper upon which a stump and
chalk may be used <i>at discretion</i>.</p>

<p>The novice must not be disappointed with the
appearance of his enlarged negative when it is finished,
nor should he form an adverse opinion of its printing
qualities until he has made a print from it. Confessedly
an enlarged negative generally presents a different
appearance to one that has been taken direct, and may
even seem to lack some of those qualities that are
commonly regarded as essential to perfection, but if the
final result, the picture, comes up to our expectations,
we may surely dismiss any lingering doubts as to
whether the enlarged negative conforms to certain preconceived
notions of technique, and it should be enough
for us to know (and the fact is incontrovertible) that
some of the finest and most artistic photographs
ever shown owe their existence to this method of
production.</p>

this class of productions.</p>

<p>Also it should be mentioned
that when these
papers are spoken of as
gelatino-chloride papers it is
not to be concluded therefrom
that chloride of silver
is the only silver salt present.
What they do actually contain
is probably only known
to their respective producers.
But generally speaking, it is
enough to say that so far as
the ordinary consumer is concerned, the family resemblance
is so strong and chief characteristics so general that the
following directions for using them may be held as<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0178" id="p0178">178</a></span>
generally applicable to the various well-known brands
now on the market. At the outset, however, it will be
convenient to note that for the purposes of manipulation
we may roughly group them into two chief classes&mdash;<i>viz.</i>,
the matt (probably from the German word "matt,"
<i>i.e.</i>, dull) and the glazed, glossy or enamelled. The
latter comes to us with a highly glazed, <i>i.e.</i>, shiny smooth
surface, the former being slightly rough, of a surface
and texture somewhat like that of very finely ground
glass.</p>

<p><i>Care of the Paper.</i>&mdash;The paper is sent out either in
the full-sized sheet, measuring about 24 × 17 inches, or
in smaller cut sizes, suitable for the usual <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1</sub> plate
and other popular dimensions of plates. Compared with
albumenized print-out paper, P.O.P. is more sensitive to
light; therefore, some care must be taken to avoid
needlessly exposing it to the influence of daylight or
strong artificial light. For example, the printing frames
should be filled as far away from any window as possible,
and the prints examined from time to time either by
gaslight or as feeble daylight as possible.</p>

<p>In handling the paper&mdash;cutting it up, etc.&mdash;care
must be taken to avoid touching the sensitive surface
with the fingers in any case. The touch of a moist or
hot finger is very likely to produce a mark or stain which
is usually irremovable. The paper should be protected
from damp, excessive heat and impure air. If kept
<i>rolled</i> in a tin tube or <i>flat</i> under pressure in the original
packages, it will keep a considerable time&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, longer
than ordinary albumenized paper.</p>

<p><i>Printing</i> is done in the usual way. Strong diffused
light reflected from the sky or clouds usually gives a
better print than direct sunshine. In case, however, of
a thin flat negative&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, one with insufficient contrast&mdash;good
results may sometimes be obtained by covering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0179" id="p0179">179</a></span>
printing frame with a sheet of green glass and printing
in moderately strong sunshine. In hot summer sunshine
it is as well to cover the green glass with a sheet of
tissue paper or fine-ground glass. Care must be always
taken when printing in sunshine or very hot weather to
see that the negative itself does not get too warm, or the
paper may stick to it. In this case the print is of course
lost, and the negative, unless varnished, is also probably
seriously damaged by silver stains, which are very
difficult to remove. Printing should not be carried
quite so far as in the case of ordinary albumenized paper
because in the subsequent operations of toning, etc.,
not so much strength is lost. The same care as regards
shielding from light, etc., should be given to the prints
after they leave the printing frame. They may be
proceeded with at once or kept for some days before being
toned, etc., but if this is done the prints should be kept
under pressure. Some workers have thought that the
light action goes on, "continues" in the print after it is
removed from the printing frame. This, however, is not
the generally received opinion.</p>

<p><i>Washing.</i>&mdash;It is important that the first washing
should be done with some care, or the prints may become
stained. The points calling for attention are (1) running
water and plenty of it, (2) care to see that the prints do
not stick together. What is needed is that the soluble
salts should be washed out of the paper as quickly as
possible, and that the prints be not allowed to remain in
the water containing these soluble salts longer than is
necessary. Hence the advantage of running water and
plenty of it. The washing water must not be too cold or
the salts will not pass out of the paper quickly enough;
and again, it must not be too warm or the gelatine will
melt. The best temperature is about 65° F., and the
limits should not go beyond 60° and 70° F., and prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0180" id="p0180">180</a></span>ably
are kept within 60° and 65° F. As the paper is
usually rather stout, it will need washing in running or
constantly changed water for about ten to fifteen
minutes, and in any case must be continued until all
milky appearance of the water ceases. The print at
this stage has a red-brown colour. If it is now passed
direct into the fixing bath without toning it becomes
somewhat more yellow, and when dry is usually a colour
somewhat between yellow ochre and sienna.</p>

<p><i>Toning</i> is usually our next operation, and for this
purpose we have a variety of toning baths recommended
by different workers. The sulphocyanide and gold is
perhaps the chief favourite.</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

	</tr>
</table>

<p>The proper way to mix this bath is to add the gold to
the solution of sulphocyanide a little at a time. The
following method will be found convenient. As ammonium
sulphocyanide is somewhat deliquescent, it is convenient
to keep it in solution. Therefore, one ounce of
the salt dissolved in twenty ounces of (distilled or filtered
rain) water gives us roughly a strength of twenty-two
grains per ounce. Dissolve the contents of a fifteen-grain
chloride of gold in fifteen drams of distilled water.
To mix a bath, take of the sulphocyanide solution half-an
ounce; to this add eight ounces of water. Now take
one dram of the gold solution and dilute with one ounce
of water. Then add this dilute gold solution a <i>little</i> at a
time to the eight ounces of sulphocyanide solution, and
stir well with a glass rod. It will be noticed that as the
gold solution drops into the sulphocyanide solution an
orange-red precipitate is formed, which is redissolved on
stirring. Hence the gold must be added to the sulphocyanide,
and not <i>vice versa</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0181" id="p0181">181</a></span>

<p>2. Another favourite bath is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Instead of weighing out two grains of sulphite it is more
convenient to weigh twenty grains and dissolve in two-and-a-half
ounces of water&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, at the rate of one grain
per dram of solution. Thus, to mix this bath, take an
ounce of the above-mentioned sulphocyanide solution
dilute with twenty ounces water. To this add two
drams (&frac14; oz.) of the sulphite solution. Then take
two drams of the gold chloride solution and dilute
with an ounce of water, and add slowly with stirring
as before.</p>

<p>Some of the adherents of this bath recommend that the
prints be only washed in running water for a few minutes
and then put into the toning bath. Others advise the
prints to be immersed in the toning bath without
any previous washing&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, straight from the printing
frame.</p>

excellent results:&mdash;</p>

<p>The various toning baths mentioned above have one
drawback common to them all in varying degrees&mdash;<i>viz.</i>,
that when once mixed and used they do not keep in good
working order longer than a few hours.</p>

<p>7. The following bath claims to have the advantage
that it will keep in working order for a short time at any
rate, but the disadvantage that it cannot be used until it
has been mixed twelve to twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>Toning should be conducted in very weak daylight,
or what is much better, gas or lamplight. The latter,
being practically constant, enables the operator to judge
the relative colour of the prints from time to time. Care
must be taken so that the prints do not stick together in
the toning bath, and preferably only a few, say half-a-dozen
or so, dealt with at a time, so that each print can
be frequently turned over and examined. The change
of colours proceeds somewhat slowly at first, but when
once it begins it seems to gain in rapidity of rate of
change, so that a careful watch must be kept. Let it be
remembered that the print, after fixing and drying, will
appear a little darker and more blue (less red) than when
wet in the toning bath. The temperature of the bath
must not be too cold or toning is very slow, nor too warm
or the gelatine may melt and toning be uneven. From
60° to 65° F. will be found a convenient range. The
prints should not be touched on their printed surface
more than can be helped. The fingers must be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0183" id="p0183">183</a></span>
clean, the solutions uncontaminated with other chemicals,
and a dish set apart for toning operations only. This
dish should always be washed out well with tepid or cold
water before and after use, and when put away should
rest flat, opening downwards, on a shelf covered with a
sheet of clean blotting paper. Many failures in toning
are entirely due to lack of care in details and sufficient
attention to cleanliness.</p>

<p>When toning is judged to be carried far enough, the
prints should be placed in a roomy dish containing a
solution of common salt, strength one ounce to twenty
or thirty ounces of water, to stop further toning.</p>

<p>Fixing is done with a "one in ten" solution of sodium
thiosulphite&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, hypo. This should be prepared with
tepid water, or some time before use, as the dissolving of
hypo in water is accompanied by a fall of temperature.
A convenient method is to place a couple of ounces of
hypo in a clean pint jug, and add about half a pint of
fairly warm water and stir with a glass rod until the salt
is dissolved, then fill up the jug from the tap with cold
water. It is highly desirable to have plenty of fixing
solution, and never attempt to use the same lot twice.
Place each print face down in the bath and submerge by
pressing on its back. Again see that the prints do not
stick to each other, and turn each print two or three
times. They should be in the fixing bath not less than
twelve or fifteen minutes, and a few minutes longer will
do no harm. At the end of, say, fifteen minutes, pour
away about one half of the fixing bath and slowly fill up
with water. Turn the prints again, and then transfer
them one by one to another roomy dish and wash in
running water for a couple of hours, or in a dozen changes
of water every five or ten minutes. Then hang up to
dry, using either clips or pin a corner to the edge of a
wooden shelf or long lath suspended in a cool, airy place.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0184" id="p0184">184</a></span>

<p><i>Alum Bath.</i>&mdash;Hot weather considerably increases
the danger of the gelatine melting. To meet this
trouble the following plan has to be resorted
to:&mdash;</p>

<p>8. Dissolve common (potash) alum, one ounce in
a pint of tepid water. Let it stand until cold and pour
off gently the clear part should any sediment appear.
After washing and before toning, place the prints
in this alum bath for about ten minutes and <i>again</i>
wash before toning for ten or fifteen minutes in running
water.</p>

<p><i>The Combined (Toning and Fixing) Bath.</i>&mdash;The
general weight of opinion is <i>not</i> in favour of combining
these two operations at one time when reliable results
are desired. Nevertheless, there are times when this
method may be found a convenience and yield results
which are all that may be desired. The following bath
is a favourite with some workers:&mdash;</p>

<p>To this is <i>slowly</i> added one grain of gold chloride in
half an ounce of water. The prints first washed for five
or ten minutes in running water, and placed in the
combined bath and kept moving by being constantly
turned over and over for about ten or fifteen minutes.
The longer they remain in the bath the more blue and
less red will they be when dried.</p>

<p>It is said that this bath gives better results if it is
prepared a few hours before use, <i>e.g.</i>, prepared in the
morning and used in the evening. Meanwhile, it should
be kept away from daylight, and not in a very cold
place.</p>

<p><i>Drying and Glazing.</i>&mdash;Some workers are of opinion that
it is better to first "rough dry" the prints, <i>e.g.</i>, by suspending
by clips, or pinning one corner to a strip of wood, etc.,
and then to wet again and dry on a rough or smooth
surface according as a matt or glazed final effect is desired.
If however, the print has been through the alum bath
(No. 8.) this preliminary rough drying may not be
necessary.</p>

<p><i>Matt Surface.</i>&mdash;The matt paper when rough dried has
a matt or slightly rough surface, but it may be desired
to accentuate the effect. This may be done as follows:&mdash;Thoroughly
clean with soap water and a nail brush a
sheet of "fine-ground" glass similar to that used for
a focussing screen. When quite dry, lightly dust it with
fine talc powder (French chalk) and polish off again with
a bit of clean rag. Now slip this plate rough side up
into a dish of cold water, which also contains the print
face downwards. Bring the print and glass into contact
under water, carefully avoiding any air bubbles between
them, as the two together are now raised from the water;
firmly, evenly, but lightly pass a squeegee over the back
of the print now in contact with the glass. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0186" id="p0186">186</a></span>
lightly press a sheet of blotting paper over the print to
take up all adhering water, and set up in a cool airy
place to dry, <i>e.g.</i>, in a passage or between the door and
half-open window. When quite dry, the print will very
probably of itself come away from the glass, but if not,
the finger nail inserted under one corner and a gently
backward pull will separate it from the glass. In place
of the fine ground glass, rougher glass of course may be
employed. Some workers also use for the same purpose
a sheet of roughened celluloid. This is more costly than
glass, but being not so fragile may prove cheaper in the
end.</p>

<p><i>Glazing Prints</i> is done exactly in the same way, with
the single difference, of course, that we use a <i>smooth</i>
piece of glass, vulcanite, celluloid, paper maché slab,
sheet of ferrotype metal, etc., etc., in place of a ground-matt,
or rough surface. All the above-named substances
have their partizans; perhaps the greatest favourite
being good plate glass free from scratches. In all cases
it is important to attend to two points, <i>viz.</i>, thoroughly
cleaning the support and waxing it. Various substances
and mixtures have been recommended for giving a glaze,
polish to the glass, etc. Many workers adhere to the
powdered talc or French chalk already mentioned.
Others prefer some of the mixtures given below:&mdash;</p>

<p>A few drops only of the lubricant are applied to the glass
plate with a bit of clean flannel, and well rubbed all
over. Then a final polish is given with a clean old silk
handkerchief, or clean dry wash leather. On no
account attempt to strip the print from the glass until
the print is <i>quite</i> dry or failure is more than likely to
arise.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0187" id="p0187">187</a></span>

<p><i>Mounting.</i>&mdash;Care should be taken that the mountant
does not give an acid reaction. Test with litmus paper.
Clearly it is no use being at the trouble of producing a
high gloss on the print if we are going to damp the print
and so destroy the gloss in the operation of mounting.
To avoid this, various plans have been adopted.</p>

<p>(1.) If a cut-out mount is used it will suffice if the print
be attached to the mount by glue at the edges only of
the "cut-out." (2.) Another method is to paste down
on to the back of the print before it is quite dry, and
while still on the glazing support, a backing of thin
waterproof paper specially prepared for this purpose.
This prevents the moisture of the mountant penetrating
to the print. (3.) Another plan is to use a mountant
which does not contain water. The following mixtures
are recommended:&mdash;</p>

<p>A fourth method is to first carefully clean the edges
of the glass surrounding the print still adhering to it.
Then to paste down the mount to the print and let all
dry. Then strip the print from the glass now already
mounted. This is, however, a process not to be
recommended, because requiring a long time for the
print to dry, as the evaporation has to take place through
the substance of the mount.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0188" id="p0188">188</a></span>

<p class="center">ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES WITH P.O.P.</p>

<p><i>Development of Partially Printed Proofs.</i>&mdash;This method
of procedure is sometimes a matter of convenience in
dull weather, etc. The printing is to be carried on until
one can just see a very slight indication of detail in the
high-lights. It is then washed in running water for about
ten minutes, and then put into a ten per cent. bath of
potassium bromide, and there it remains for another ten
minutes or so. In this bath some of the image seems to
fade away, and generally the print takes on a yellow
tinge. The print is next washed in running water for
about ten minutes, and then developed with ortol, metol,
or preferably, hydroquinone. A considerable variation
in the proportions of the constituents of the developer
are possible. In general terms, one may say that a
developer which gives a good black and white lantern
slide when diluted with about an equal quantity of water
will give a satisfactory print.</p>
<a name="f17" id="f17"></a>
<p>17. As an example of a thoroughly practical
developer for this purpose we may give just one
example:&mdash;</p>

<p>Take equal parts and mix just before use, wash for at
least ten minutes in running water at once after development.</p>

<p>Developed prints may be toned in the combined
bath 9, 10 or 11, or may first be fixed, then <i>thoroughly</i>
washed, and then toned and again washed.</p>

<p>If good results are wanted by the development
process it is important to be careful that the paper is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0189" id="p0189">189</a></span>
exposed even to weak daylight more than can be helped,
and not even to strong artificial light more than is
necessary. At the same time it is quite practicable to
do the operation of the bromide bath and developing in
fairly strong gas-light, <i>i.e.</i>, one need by no means be
limited to the ordinary dark-room light as when
developing plates.</p>

<p>Another point worth noting is that it is quite
practicable to use magnesium ribbon for printing. For
a rather thin negative it will be perhaps found sufficient
to burn about a foot of the metal ribbon about three or
four inches from the glass. The printing frame should
be set up on edge in the vertical plane. The strip of
metal ribbon is held by a pair of pliers, and ignited at
the flame of a candle or spirit lamp. The lid of a biscuit
box just in front of the frame does very well to catch the
white magnesium oxide formed by burning. It is as well
to move the flame of the burning metal opposite various
parts of the negative during the exposure. It will be
found a comfort to wear a pair of rather dark blue glasses
during this operation, as the bright light of combustion
prevents one seeing anything with ease for a little
while.</p>

<p>After development the print may be fixed only, and
under certain conditions it is possible to obtain a fairly
satisfactory black or brown colour without toning, but
there is usually a slight tendency towards rather too
much yellow.</p>

<p><i>Platinum Toning.</i>&mdash;This method of toning is a
favourite with many workers. By it a considerable
variety of colour tones may be obtained, from a rich
red chocolate brown through sepia brown to a warm
black.</p>

<p>The following toning baths have each their several
advocates, and each worker must discover by experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0190" id="p0190">190</a></span>
the one that gives him the particular brown colour he
prefers:&mdash;</p>

white cotton. Having thoroughly washed the print for
<i>at least</i> ten minutes in running water, lay it face up on a

<p>The chief points to bear in mind in platinum toning
are: (1) that the print must have practically all the free
silver washed away before toning. To this end it is a
very good plan to dip each print for a couple of minutes
or so in a bath of table salt one ounce, water ten ounces,
and again rinse under the tap for a minute or two.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0191" id="p0191">191</a></span>

<p>(2) That the toning bath is acid, therefore one must
either neutralize this acidity by passing through an
alkaline bath, such as No. 19, or what perhaps is rather
more convenient, though not quite so desirable&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
using a fixing bath made distinctly alkaline. The
following proportions are recommended:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Toning with Gold and Platinum.</i>&mdash;A large number of
experimenters have tried to find out how to produce
platinotype-like effects with P.O.P. papers. Perhaps
none of them have been completely successful. The
following procedure, however, seems to give the nearest
approach to that ideal.</p>

<p>The best results are obtained with a slightly matt-surfaced
paper. This should be printed a shade or two
deeper than the print is intended to appear finally. The
print is well washed and then <i>partly</i> toned in a gold
bath:&mdash;</p>

<p>Wash for five minutes and fix in bath 23.</p>

<p><i>Intensifying and Reducing P.O.P.</i>&mdash;When the negative
is obtainable and printable it is <i>very</i> much better, and
altogether more satisfactory to make a fresh print than
to attempt to intensify or reduce an unsatisfactory one.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it sometimes happens that this course
is not possible, and the best has to be made from an
unsatisfactory print.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0192" id="p0192">192</a></span>

<p>If the print is only very lightly printed, and comes
straight from the printing frame, it is best to strengthen
it by development (see <a href="#f17">formula 17</a> <i>et seq.</i>). If the print
has been toned and fixed, etc., the following may be
tried:&mdash;</p>

<p>26. Make a <i>saturated solution</i> of mercury bichloride in
cold water, let it settle, and use only the quite clear
supernatent liquid. Immerse the print in this for 15
minutes, turning it from time to time, and see that no air
bells are clinging to either side. Wash the print in
running water for 15 minutes at least, and longer if
convenient. Then immerse it in a bath consisting of
strong ammonia one part, water ten or twelve parts.
Again wash for five minutes under the tap.</p>

<p>The advocates of this solution claim for it that it can be
used either <i>before</i> or <i>after</i> toning with equal facility and
advantage. Prints must be well washed both before and
after its use in any case.</p>

<p>Another method, which is somewhat risky except in
expert hands, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>28. Dissolve metal iodine in alcohol to a rich dark
port wine colour. Dilute a small quantity with cold
water until the whole is a pale sherry colour. Now
prepare a one in ten solution of potassium cyanide (<i>N.B.:
a powerful poison</i>) and add this a <i>little</i> at a time until the
pale yellow colour of the iodine solution is just discharged.</p>

<p>The print may be immersed in this until sufficiently
reduced, or it may be applied locally with cotton wool
mop (as described above under platinum toning formula
18). The print must of course be quickly washed just
before the desired degree of reduction has been produced.<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0193" id="p0193">193</a></span>
This solution acts somewhat quickly when once the
action begins, and therefore it is well to deal with prints
one at a time.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEFECTS, ETC.</p>

<p><i>Red-orange</i> patches are usually due to touching the
gelatine surface with dirty fingers, etc. These places,
being somewhat greasy, repel the various fluids and
cause uneven action of the developing, toning, etc.</p>

<p><i>Brown Stains</i> are also often produced in the same
way. They may <i>sometimes</i> be removed by the application
of a saturated solution of alum. If this fails one may
try "chloride of lime" ("bleaching powder") one part in
twenty parts of hot water. Allow to stand until cold
and apply with cotton wool mop.</p>

<p><i>Yellow Stains</i> may sometimes be removed by a dilute
solution of potassium cyanide (poison) of strength one
part cyanide in fifty parts water. (Yellow stains usually
indicate hypo splashes.)</p>

<p><i>General Fog from Age.</i>&mdash;This sometimes may be considerably
reduced by giving the prints the bath of: Soda
sulphite (one in fifteen) <i>before</i> toning, but well washing
after this bath and before toning.</p>

<p><i>Very Slow Toning</i> generally points to the fact that
the toning bath is too cold, or that it has been spoilt by a
small quantity of hypo or developer, or that it does not
contain sufficient gold.</p>

<p><i>Uneven Toning, i.e.</i>, blue edges, generally points to a
bath too strong in gold, or that there are too many
prints in the bath at once, so that the edges are getting
more of the metal than the central parts, or it may arise
from prints sticking together or to the bottom of the
dish.</p>

<p><i>Blue-Grey Tones</i> indicate too long a time in the toning
bath, or a bath too strong in gold.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0194" id="p0194">194</a></span>

<p><i>Red-Yellow Tones</i> arise from just the opposite state
of affairs.</p>

<p><i>Pinking</i> of the high-lights points to the bath being
too weak or becoming worked out.</p>

<p><i>Double Toning</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the print shewing different
colours, points to insufficient washing or uneven action
of the toning bath, <i>i.e.</i>, not keeping the prints moving,
or too slow toning, or that the toning bath does not suit
the brand of paper.</p>

<p><i>Blisters</i> are usually due either to using a hypo
fixing bath too strong, or passing the print from one
solution to another of a markedly different temperature.
Hence the importance of dissolving the hypo either in
tepid water or some time before use. The best all-round
temperature for working this process is between the
limits of 60° and 65° F.</p>

<p><i>Tinting P.O.P.</i>&mdash;The colours to be used may be the
usual moist water colours by some good maker, or
solutions of aniline colours. These latter may usually
be dissolved in water and applied in thin washes. The
surface of the print should be rubbed as little as possible.
If water colours are to be used it will be found helpful
to prepare the surface of the print with one or other of
the following preparations.</p>

<p>Apply evenly and quickly with a spray diffuser or with
a broad soft brush, and let the print become <i>nearly</i> dry
before applying the colours.</p>

<p>30. The white of an egg in twenty ounces of water.
Shake well, then add ammonia drop by drop until the
mixture just very faintly smells of it. Filter and brush
over the surface of the print. In mixing the water
colours also use this albumen solution in place of
water.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0195" id="p0195">195</a></span>

<p><i>Advantages of P.O.P.</i>&mdash;As compared with ordinary
albumenized silver paper the P.O.P. class has the
advantage of giving more detail with marked transparency
in the shadows. The operations are more
flexible and the results are as permanent, if not more so,
than those on albumen paper. The paper keeps in good
condition for a longer time. The negative giving the
best results with P.O.P. is one having delicacy rather
than vigour, <i>i.e.</i>, a long scale of gradation of delicate
steps is well rendered. Printing takes place quicker
with P.O.P. than with albumen papers. The cost of
paper and materials is much about the same in both
instances.</p>

<p><i>Notes.</i>&mdash;In the glazed variety of paper the smooth
shiny surface is the sensitive one, and, of course, goes
next the negative in the printing frame. In the matt
paper the sensitive side may generally be known by its
tendency to curl inward, <i>i.e.</i>, the concave or hollow side
is the printing side.</p>

<p>Formalin may be used in place of alum for hardening
the gelatine. Of the usual 40 per cent. solution of
formalin take one ounce and dilute with ten or twelve
ounces of water.</p>

<p>Dark spots or specks are frequently due to metallic
dust either from the fingers or in the water. Mounts
having sham gold edges or bronze powders should be
banished from the dark-room. Dry "pyro" floating in
the air may also account for spots.</p>

<p>Amongst the various
printing processes in
common use amongst photographers,
platinotype is unique
in several respects.</p>

<p>Printing is conducted by
daylight in precisely the same
manner as silver printing,
but the action of light only
suffices to make the image
partially visible. In this
respect, platinotype stands,
as it were, midway between
what are familiarly termed
"print-out" processes&mdash;that
is, those in which the image
is made completely visible
by daylight, and those in
which the action of light is
latent or invisible, such as
bromide paper and in the
carbon process.</p>

<p>The distinctive character of the platinotype print,
with which, probably, everyone is so familiar that a
platinotype effect almost amounts to a generic term, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0198" id="p0198">198</a></span>
not so much essential to the process, but has been
largely determined by the different kind of papers and
the preparation of those adopted by the manufacturers of
platinotype printing papers.</p>

<p>In the first place, the platinotype print is before
anything a matt surface print, and possesses a certain
kind of texture or surface which gives the finished print
an appearance similar to a pencil drawing or an
engraving; an appearance largely assisted by the
characteristic colour of the platinum image, which is
black.</p>

<p>The invention and production of platinotype paper
is due to Mr. Willis and the Platinotype Company, and
although subsequently there have been both English and
foreign imitators, we may safely confine our attention to
those papers made and supplied by the Platinotype
Company.</p>

<p>As, however, the purpose of this article is to furnish
the beginner with simple working instructions, rather
than to describe the principles of the process, we will at
once proceed to say how a platinotype print is made.</p>

<p>To begin with, platinotype printing is divided into
cold-bath process and hot-bath process. Of the latter
we shall speak later on, but for the present, as being
most suitable for the amateur and beginner, we will
consider the cold-bath method. The reason for this
division and the meaning of the name will be abundantly
evident presently.</p>

<p>We first of all procure a tin of paper of the quality
marked AA. The paper is put up in tin cylinders
containing twenty-four pieces of either &frac14;-plate or &frac12;-plate
sizes, or less for larger sizes. It may, if preferred, be
obtained in full-size sheets 20 × 26 inches.</p>

<p>We have now to bear in mind that the paper is
sensitive to daylight to a slightly greater degree than<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0199" id="p0199">199</a></span>
are the silver print-out papers, and hence, whilst
handling the paper, placing it in the printing frames, or
what not, we need to be a little more careful as to how
near the window we bring the paper. At the side of the
room furthest from the window, or with an intervening
screen between the paper and the window, or yet again,
with the blind drawn down, we shall be quite safe in
opening our tin of paper and inspecting it.</p>

<p>On removing the lid of the tin we find a false top
or cover hermetically sealing it, which has to be cut
through in the manner becoming customary with
various tinned foods and comestibles.</p>

<p>We then find that the paper within is yellow on one
side which is the sensitive side. Within the roll of
papers at the bottom of the tin we shall find a hard
irregular lump of some substance wrapped round with
cotton wool. Keep this in the tin and now note its use
from the following:&mdash;Platinotype paper is highly susceptible
to moisture and deteriorates under its influence. The
air we breathe, and therefore the air enclosed within the
tin case or any other vessel contains a large amount of
moisture, and this moisture would be taken up by the
platinotype paper to its own detriment. The presence
of water or moisture in the atmosphere or in things we
handle, although quite unperceived by us, would be
discoverable by the platinum salts on the paper, which
would thus become unfit for use, hence the only way of
preserving it is by placing in the tin containing the paper
some chemical which is even more susceptible to
moisture than platinotype paper. Such a body is
calcium chloride, and this it is which we find wrapped
in cotton wool in each tin tube of paper, or to speak more
accurately it is asbestos prepared in a solution of
calcium chloride. So long as that little lump remains
dry and hard we may be quite sure that it has left no<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0200" id="p0200">200</a></span>
moisture in the air around it for the platinotype paper,
and it will go on drinking it up until it becomes softened
by saturation, when it must be removed and a fresh
piece substituted, or it may be restored to its former
condition by drying it on a red-hot shovel, the asbestos
remaining unconsumed.</p>

<p>Whilst perhaps in after practice we may find it
possible to relax our precautions against damp, yet at
the outset the necessity of the utmost caution being
observed cannot be too strongly insisted upon. Out of
a very large number of prints representing the beginner's
first attempts at platinotype, by far the greatest number
of failures are due to damp, and this, probably, for want
of conception of the danger to which the paper is
exposed. Remember then that where there is ordinary
air there is also abundant moisture, and as no tin box
with a movable lid is air-tight, neither is it moisture-proof,
but in the case of our tin of platinotype paper
when once opened will go on admitting moisture which the
calcium chloride will take up until it can take no more.</p>

<p>After having cut through the inner sealed top of
the tin, close up the little hole in the outer lid where the
cutting point is with sealing wax, next cover the mouth
of the tube with a piece of waxed paper or tinfoil, shut
the lid down on to this, and then cover the junction of
the lid with a broad indiarubber band. In this way
damp may be prevented from gaining access to the inside
of the tube to a great extent.</p>

<p>Specially constructed tubes are made which close
with an air-tight stopper and have a false bottom with a
perforated partition in which the calcium chloride may
be kept. Such a "calcium-tube," as it is called, if not
an absolute necessity, is a very desirable acquisition.</p>

<p>If you now take the negative to be printed from and
hold it near the fire or a spirit lamp, it will on becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0201" id="p0201">201</a></span>
warm give off perceptible moisture, thus showing that
it was distinctly damp before. The negative, therefore,
should be dried before being brought into contact with
the platinotype paper.</p>

<p>The wood printing frame itself, if it has been used
for printing in the open air, should be placed in an oven
or held near the fire to thoroughly dry it.</p>

<p>Having placed the negative and the platinotype
paper in the frame in the ordinary manner, there should
next be placed at the back of the paper a thin sheet of
waterproof cloth, vulcanized rubber of the proper size
and thickness being sold for the purpose; this will
prevent damp from penetrating to the paper from the
back of the frame. The frame may now be closed and
placed in the light for printing, and even having taken
all these elaborate precautions against damp it would
not be advisable to print out of doors except in dry
weather, nor should the paper be left in the frame longer
than need be, but if it is not proposed to finish the print
off at once, it should be returned as soon as convenient
to the security of the calcium tube.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS.</p>

<p>Platinotype paper is ordinarily only available for
daylight printing, though the Platinotype Company
have introduced a lamp of special construction and great
power, by the use of which daylight may be dispensed
with, and electric light, should it be available, may
be used.</p>

<p>As has been already said, platinotype paper is
rather more sensitive to light than silver paper, and
hence takes proportionately less time to print.</p>

<p>The duration of the exposure to light constitutes
the only real difficulty in platinotype printing, and
whilst just at first it may result in the beginner's meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0202" id="p0202">202</a></span>
with much disappointment, yet probably, with a little
care and watchfulness the trouble will be surmounted,
and sufficient experience gained to secure fairly uniform
success thereafter, before even the first tube of paper
has been used.</p>

<p>The printed image shows on the yellow ground of
the sensitized side as a faint grey, the darkest portions
assuming an orange-grey tint, whilst the lighter parts
remain all but invisible.</p>

<p>A little practice will enable one to judge the right
depth, that is to say, how visible the image should
be before printing is to be stopped, but as a rough
guide to commence with it may be said that printing
is complete when the image is about half as deep
as we should expect it to be if it were a "print-out"
process.</p>

<p>As we shall have occasion to return to the question
of printing presently, we may now pass to the next step
in the process.</p>

<p>In twenty-five ounces of hot water dissolve half a
pound of best neutral oxalate of potash, and keep this in
a stoppered bottle as stock solution. What is known as
<i>neutral</i> oxalate should be used, and in order to ensure
having a suitable salt it had better be obtained from a
recognised photographic chemist or dealer.</p>

<p>As the above solution becomes cool, a good deal of
the oxalate will probably settle at the bottom in the
form of solid crystals; of these no notice need be taken,
for as long as there are undissolved crystals at the
bottom of the bottle we know we have a saturated
solution.</p>

<p>We shall now require a dish of porcelain or
enamelled iron, and if we choose the latter great care
must be taken to see that the enamel is not cracked or
blistered, as it will have an injurious effect if the oxalate<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0203" id="p0203">203</a></span>
of potash solution obtain access to the iron under the
enamel.</p>

<p>As it will be convenient to be able to alter the
temperature of the solution when in this dish at will, a
spirit lamp or stove or a small gas-stove will be a useful,
if not an essential addition. Over such heating apparatus
the dish should be supported on an iron tripod, or by
any extemporized substitute.</p>

<p>If a porcelain dish be used, a thin sheet of iron
should be placed first on the tripod stand, and then
three or four scraps of iron, large common iron nails
will serve very well, and on these the porcelain dish is
allowed to rest so that it does not come into direct
contact with the iron plate.</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to save the dish from cracking,
moreover the iron plate becomes hot, and retaining
a good deal of heat serves as a kind of accumulator which
goes far to maintain the dish and the contained solution
at a uniform temperature for at least a short time.
Even better than this arrangement will be an iron dish
filled with clean dry sand, the porcelain dish to rest on
the sand which retains much heat.</p>

<p>If an enamelled iron dish be employed, these precautions
are not so necessary, though they may still be
used with advantage.</p>

<p>Next we shall require another dish or similar vessel
into which we pour a weak solution of hydrochloric
acid, the usual proportions being:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">70</td>
		<td class="tdl">parts.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Pure hydrochloric acid</td>
		<td class="tdr">1</td>
		<td class="tdl">part.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>This constitutes the whole of the very simple apparatus
needed, and we may now proceed to develop our
print, which as already described is exposed to light in
a printing frame in the usual manner until the image
appears rather less than half-printed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0204" id="p0204">204</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT OF THE PRINT.</p>

<p>If convenient it would be an advantage to have the
above-mentioned apparatus set up close to the window
or other situation where the printing is actually carried on
in order that each print may be developed and finished
off forthwith,; the reason for this will, I think, appear as
we proceed.</p>

<p>Development&mdash;that is, the changing of the print
from the partially visible condition to its full degree of
intensity&mdash;is practically instantaneous. The image does
not gradually attain its maximum strength as in a
negative or bromide print, but does so within a few
seconds of its coming into contact with the oxalate of
potash solution.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 1.">
	<a name="cp0204" id="cp0204" ></a>

	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 1.</span>
</div>

<p>Having put into the dish on the tripod stand sufficient
of the saturated solution of oxalate of potash to
cover the bottom of the dish to the depth of half an inch
or an inch, we light the lamp or stove and bring the
solution up to a temperature of about 70° Fahrenheit.
This may be tested with a thermometer or may very
well be guessed by touch; we merely require the solution
quite warm, but not so hot as to cause the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0205" id="p0205">205</a></span>
inconvenience if the fingers are placed therein. This
will be a sufficiently accurate guide as to temperature.</p>

<p>In case any dust or scum should have accumulated
on the surface of the bath, wipe the surface of the
solution with a piece of clean paper, and now take the
first print to be developed in both hands, giving it a
decided curl, or roll it round into a cylinder <i>sensitive side
out</i>, so that it naturally takes a curled-up form (Fig. 1).
We now take the print to the dish containing the oxalate
solution without previous washing and without exposing
the paper to the influence of light or moisture, and
lowering the edge of the paper held in the left hand,
sensitive side downwards, until it touches the fluid
quickly and smoothly bring the rest of the print down
until the right-hand end finally reaches the solution,
then give it a sliding sort of shake in order to set free
any bubbles of air which may be imprisoned under the
paper, and then on raising the paper again after five to
ten seconds, the image will be found to have come out
to the full degree of visibility, which the amount of
exposure had paved the way for.</p>

<p>The paper may be returned to the oxalate bath for
a minute or two longer if it be thought desirable, though
only in the case of a very cold bath is any effect produced
on the print by the oxalate after the first few
seconds. The print is then passed <i>direct</i> to the hydrochloric
acid bath, which should be ready in a dish close
at hand, and the print is now practically finished.</p>

<p>Before placing the print in the acid bath it may be
noticed that the portions of the print not affected by light
still remain yellow, and this yellowness the acid bath
removes almost at once.</p>

<p>In order to effectually remove the yellow surface
(which is the unacted-upon sensitive salts and hence
upon their removal the permanence of the print depends)<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0206" id="p0206">206</a></span>
three successive applications of the acid bath should be
resorted to, the prints remaining for 5 to 10 minutes in
each, and then finally washed in running water for a
quarter-of-an-hour, dried between blotting paper or in
any other manner preferred, and the platinotype print
is finished and ready for mounting.</p>

<p>It should be seen from the foregoing general outline
of the process that for directness, simplicity, and for the
short time in which a finished print may be produced
that platinotype stands alone amongst printing methods.</p>

<p>There are, however, some points needing careful
consideration at each stage of the print's production,
and to these we may now pay attention.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AS REGARDS EXPOSURE.</p>

<p>As has already been stated right exposure constitutes
the crux of the whole process; this once mastered
the rest of the performance&mdash;development, clearing in
acid and washing&mdash;is so simple that the chance of
failure is remote.</p>

<p>Hence the greater need of paying especial attention
to the question of exposure or printing.</p>

<p>Obviously, the duration of time of exposure cannot
be fixed, not even to the extent it can be in bromide
printing or any other method of printing with artificial
light which may be a definite and permanent quantity.</p>

<p>The variable quality of the daylight and the density
of the negative are both fluctuating factors in the calculation
and hence some means may advisedly be resorted
to for acquiring a sort of exposure index suitable for
each individual negative and every variety of light.</p>

<p>First let it be noted that even with very great over-exposure
the image will not become wholly visible,
whilst to the inexperienced eye but little change takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0207" id="p0207">207</a></span>
place in the appearance of the printed image after the
correct exposure has been reached.</p>

<p>If then the print has been over-exposed, the fact is
not made evident until the print is subjected to the
influence of the oxalate developing bath.</p>

<p>To start platinotype work trusting to chance or good
fortune to secure for us good results, means that our whole
course will be one of uncertainty and filled with exasperating
disappointments to say nothing of the amount
of paper and material which is certain to be wasted in
unsuccessful efforts.</p>

<p>The reader will probably have learned something
of this from his past experiences of negative exposure,
the difficulties of which he has by now, we may hope,
overcome by careful and patient study, or else if he is
not even now undergoing this stage of learning he is
the victim of endless mistakes, every plate exposed is a
shot in the dark with no certainty attending any one of
them.</p>

<p>Exposure, however, in platinotype is not so difficult
a matter as that of a dry plate, and the correct exposure
with any particular negative once ascertained, every
subsequent print from the same negative can, by simple
mechanical means, be made with the certainty of its
being <i>an exact facsimile</i> of the others.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PRINTING WITH AN ACTINOMETER.</p>

<p>Several kinds of Actinometers are made for sale,
the purpose of which is either to indicate the right
exposure of a plate in the camera or to tell the duration
of exposure for papers such as platinotype or carbon,
the image on which is invisible, or nearly so.</p>

<p>A simple, yet thoroughly efficient meter may be
made as follows:&mdash;Cut some fine tissue paper or <i>papier
minéral</i> into strips about a quarter of an inch wide and<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0208" id="p0208">208</a></span>
attach one to a piece of clean glass 4&frac14; × 3&frac14; with fresh
starch or other colourless mountant. Upon this first
strip and exactly over it place a second, but bring it to
within a quarter of an inch of the end of the first, next
place a third strip in like manner a quarter of an inch
short of the second strip, and so on until some seven or
eight strips have been fixed. The combination will now
be somewhat as the following drawing (Fig. 2), thus
forming a tissue band which at each quarter-inch is one
thickness more opaque.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 2.">
	<a name="cp0208a" id="cp0208a" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0208-a-400.jpg" width="400" height="57" alt="fig 2"/>
	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 2.</span>
</div>

<p>In the centre of each strip or increased thickness,
paint with opaque colour, black or red, a letter or figure
as in (Fig. 3). On the back or other side of the glass
to which these strips are attached, paint over or cover
with opaque paper all except the space covered by the
strips. Now place the whole in an ordinary &frac14;-plate
printing frame, with the paper strips inside, next adjust
a piece of silver paper, albumenized, or gelatine chloride
precisely as though printing from a negative. Close the
back and we then have a thoroughly efficient actinometer.</p>


<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 3.">
	<a name="cp0208b" id="cp0208b" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0208-b-400.jpg" width="400" height="57" alt="fig 3"/>
	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 3.</span>
</div>

<p>We now put out our first piece of platinotype paper
to print, and alongside it so as to receive the exact same
amount of light, we place our actinometer.</p>

<p>The first print must admittedly be guess-work.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0209" id="p0209">209</a></span>

<p>After an interval of time, which may vary from say
fifteen minutes to an hour according to the amount of
light, we will withdraw the frame containing the platinotype
print, and <i>simultaneously turn the actinometer over with
its face down</i>, thus stopping its printing whilst examining
the platinotype.</p>

<p>Retiring from the light we examine the progress of
printing precisely as in silver printing, and we shall
probably find that the image on the negative is now
faintly visible on the platinotype paper, impressed in a
sort of warm grey colour.</p>

<p>If the darkest portions are of about the tint which
we might produce by shading with an H pencil on a
piece of primrose yellow or pale buff paper, we may
reckon that the print has been sufficiently exposed.</p>

<p>Now refer to the actinometer and see what has
taken place on the silver paper which we put into it.
Probably while the platinotype paper has been reaching
the required depth of printing, the silver paper has also
registered the image of the strips of paper, and has
become printed through up to the fourth or fifth step of
the tissue strips, showing on each strip its letter in
white. Make a note of the highest letter visible and
proceed to develop the platinotype print. If upon
development the print is weak and grey, lacking depth
or intensity in the deepest shadows, and having blank
and detailless whites for the higher tones, we may reckon
that our print is under-exposed. The letter visible then,
<i>with that particular negative</i> is not sufficient. We then shift
the paper in the actinometer so as to get a fresh portion
under the tissue strips, or we substitute a new piece.
We refill the printing frame and print again until the
actinometer registers one, two, or three more steps and
letters, and then try again. If, however, in the first case
the platinotype print upon development gives a heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0210" id="p0210">210</a></span>
dark print, with the details in shadows blocked up, and
the high-lights grey, the whole possessing an overdone
appearance, then in our second attempt we shall stop
printing when the actinometer records some one or two
letters less. But we may be more fortunate in our first
attempt, and the print may be about right. In that
case we mark on that negative in some way the tint or
step or letter in the actinometer at which we arrested
action, and henceforth, no matter the time of year, hour
of the day, or latitude, that negative will give a similar
print if stopped in accordance with that memorandum
which it bears.</p>

<p>If, however, we do not hit the right exposure the first
time, we are pretty certain to do so the second, or at the
most the third time, and having done so, we have not
only an infallible guide for all subsequent prints from
that same negative, but we have also some sort of index
to base our calculations on for other negatives. Thus
if we at once proceed to print from another negative,
that is, before any considerable alteration takes place in
the light, we may by comparing the negatives at least
estimate what will probably be the second negative's
printing letter or step on the actinometer. Sooner or
later every negative (especially those from which we
anticipate wanting subsequent prints) should bear either
on the negative itself, or else in a carefully kept register
or note book its correct printing letter.</p>

<p>Although this may seem a rather laborious practice,
it is not so in reality, and so great is its educational
power that I anticipate that after the first dozen or so
negatives we shall almost dispense with the actinometer
altogether, having by then trained the eye to tell when
a print is finished merely by the appearance of the half-visible
image. Do not let this prospect, however, tempt
the beginner to dispense with this valuable help at first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0211" id="p0211">211</a></span>
for to the inexperienced eye the appearance of the
platinotype image is very deceptive, and having under-exposed
the first print, it will not be safe to judge the
extra printing of the next print only by the eye; the
beginner is nearly certain to err, and the eye must not
be trusted until it has had considerable training.</p>

<p>After having had some considerable and varied
experience in platinotype printing, one feels no little
regret that an operation which has become so simple
cannot be laid before a beginner in a more precise and
definite manner, and I can only assure my reader that in
a very little while what may now look like a very serious
business, only surmountable by long and serious practice,
will become a sort of intuitive faculty, and just as one
feels after a little practice the precise amount of pressure
which one should use when the fingers are placed on the
notes of the piano, so just the right <i>visible</i> depth of print
required to give a developed print of such and such
intensity comes to be a matter of instinct.</p>

<p>It may here be stated that paper which has been
affected by damp gives a slightly less visible image than
dry paper. But moisture alone without oxalate will
effect partial development, and if the time of exposure to
light be so greatly prolonged, that despite all precautions
moisture obtains access to the print during exposure,
this may, as it were, start a kind of local development
whilst the paper is still in the frame and printing,
so that on looking at the print to watch its progress
some of the deeper shadows may have sprung quite
suddenly into a deep blackish-grey colour. In many
cases this will quite spoil the finished result, whilst in
others no harm seems to be done when the print is
ultimately developed.</p>

<p>Remembering that the high-lights and indeed some
of the lighter tints of the print are quite invisible until<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0212" id="p0212">212</a></span>
after development, care should be taken to look at the
paper only in decidedly subdued light, or better still,
artificial light, because the injury which is being done
by even a short exposure to actinic light is not made
manifest until after development, and as most of us know
how soon a piece of silver paper will discolour in even
moderately faint daylight, we should be additionally
cautious with platinotype paper which is from twice to
three times as sensitive to light.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">SOME POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH REGARD TO DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion it will be well to repeat here
that at present we are only considering the practice of
what is known as the cold-bath paper. This term is
applied only in a comparative sense. The older hot-bath
process requires the developing bath to be raised to a
temperature of about 170° F., whereas the best temperature
for the cold process is about 70° F. or even less;
nevertheless, the cold-bath paper <i>may</i> be developed in
an oxalate bath of 170° or even hotter, so also it may be
developed on a solution which is quite cold. The result
of altering the temperature is two-fold and may be
stated thus:&mdash;<i>The colder the bath</i>, the <i>colder</i> the colour,
that is, the <i>bluer</i> the greys and blacks, also development
is slower and takes longer, and the contrasts harder.
<i>The hotter the bath</i> the warmer or browner the colour
of the print; the more sudden the development and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0213" id="p0213">213</a></span>
greater the amount of half-tone and consequent softer
contrasts.</p>

<p>With these maxims in mind some amount of control
may be exercised over the prints produced, especially as
regards arresting development at any point desired if a
cold developer be used, but in such case the print must
be instantly removed to and plunged into the acid bath,
until which immersion development continues, even after
the print has been removed from the bath.</p>

<p>Development, as a general rule, should be conducted
in feeble daylight or artificial light.</p>

<p>Development need not take place immediately, but
at some subsequent time, provided the prints be meanwhile
stored in a calcium tube and in every way
rigorously protected from damp.</p>

<p>The proportions which I have given for the oxalate
of potash bath represent the standard developer as given
by the makers of the paper for the hot-bath papers, and
they recommend that this be diluted to about half
strength for cold-bath papers. Personally, I use it at
full strength for the cold process, and see no reason for
diluting it.</p>

<p>It may be said that such a course is calculated to
give strong, vigorous prints, for generally speaking, the
stronger the bath, the stronger the contrasts of the print.
The difference, however, produced by altering the
strength of the bath is not very great.</p>

<p>There are two alternatives to the oxalate of potash
developer, both possessing certain, if not very strongly
marked characteristics. The first of these is known as
the "D" salts. These are sold in tins by the Platinotype
Company, and consist of a loose admixture of
certain salts, and hence it is essential that the entire
contents of a half-pound tin be dissolved at once and
kept thus as a stock solution.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0214" id="p0214">214</a></span>

<p>The proportions to be used are as follows: Dissolve
&frac12; lb. of D salts in 50 ozs. water, and then take equal
portions of this solution and water, in other words, dilute
it to half-strength.</p>

<p>The "D" salts are said to give colder colours and
more half-tone, but the colour derived from development
on the first-named oxalate bath may be made colder by
adding to 20 parts of developer 1 part of a saturated
solution of oxalic acid, in like manner slightly warmer
colour may be obtained if the oxalate bath be made
alkaline by the addition of carbonate of potash, but only
just enough should be added to turn a red litmus test
paper blue.</p>

<p>If prints developed on D salts should appear mealy or
granulated, the bath should be strengthened or used at the
full strength of the stock solution (salts &frac12; lb. to water 50 oz.).</p>

<p>Another developer, the effect of which is to minimize
half-tone and increase the vigour of the contrasts,
and so give very brilliant and even hard blacks and
whites, is as follows:</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Oxalate of potash</td>
		<td class="tdr">16</td>
		<td class="tdl">ozs.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Phosphate of potash</td>
		<td class="tdr">4</td>
		<td class="tdl">ozs.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Sulphate of potash</td>
		<td class="tdr">&frac12;</td>
		<td class="tdl">oz.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">120</td>
		<td class="tdl">ozs.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>This should be made with hot water, and to get the full
advantage of its contrast-giving powers, used quite cold.
Development will then probably take one or two minutes,
but can be arrested sooner when the desired effect is
attained.</p>

<p>It may now be as well to enumerate and describe
the various kinds of platinotype paper obtainable, and
whilst the general treatment of them all is the same as
described in the foregoing, some special recommendations
may be made in each case.</p>

<p>The papers for the Cold-Bath process are two called
respectively AA and CC. AA is a smooth surface<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0215" id="p0215">215</a></span>
paper and is the kind usually employed for portraiture
and general small work. CC is a heavier, stronger
paper with a surface similar to stout cartridge or drawing
paper. For pictorial work and for landscapes, also for
large portraits or heads this paper is eminently suitable.</p>

<p>Next we have the papers for Hot-Bath process, to
be presently described. These are firstly A and C, both
precisely the same in character as the AA and CC just
referred to, but intended to be developed in a bath at
high temperature. These four kinds of paper all yield
a picture of the normal platinotype black colour, the
black tending to cooler or warmer tints according to
slight modifications of treatment, but it is also possible
to produce a platinotype print of a rich sepia brown by
using the papers S and RS&mdash;these both in substance and
character corresponding with AA or A and CC or C
respectively. Thus we have a thin smooth and a thick
rough paper for each Cold bath, Hot bath, and for Sepia
printing.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DEVELOPMENT OF HOT-BATH AND SEPIA PAPERS.</p>

<p>With the Hot-Bath papers perhaps the precautions
against damp should be rather more stringent than for
Cold-Bath papers, certainly they may not be relaxed,
and in the sepia papers, S and RS, there seems to be
even greater susceptibility still, but for this, printing and
development are performed precisely as already described,
but the temperature of the oxalate bath should not be
less than 150° to 170°, whilst in some cases it may be
convenient to raise it still higher. The oxalate solution
should, moreover, always be at full strength, namely,
&frac12; lb. in 25 ozs. of water or thereabouts, a much more
diluted bath will result in granular prints.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0216" id="p0216">216</a></span>

<p>As a general rule the colour of A and C prints is a
rather browner black than their cold-bath equivalents&mdash;AA
and CC&mdash;with also rather softer contrasts.</p>

<p>Development takes place in shorter time than with
cold-bath papers, and is indeed so instantaneous that any
control is next to impossible. On this account, rather
more dexterity will be required in development, that is
to say, between the time that one end of the print
touches the developer and the rest of the print is brought
into contact with it, the shortest possible time should
elapse. There must be no hesitation, the whole surface
must be brought down gradually but swiftly, and
accompanied by a sliding movement in order to squeeze
out or wipe out any air bubbles which might cling to
the surface of the paper. If this be not done evenly and
continuously, it is more than likely that there will be
marks of unequal development on the surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 5.">
	<a name="cp0216" id="cp0216" ></a>
	<img src="images/cp0216-300.png" width="300" height="197" alt="fig 5"/>
	<br />
	<span class="caption">Fig. 5.</span>
</div>

<p>It is no uncommon thing for the tyro to let the print
hover over the bath before giving it its plunge in the
hot solution, but in so doing it should be remembered
that he is submitting it to the direct action of the steam
which the bath is giving off, and so exposing it to damp.</p>

<p>Whilst with prints of &frac12;-plate size and under it may
be sufficient to hold the print by one corner and wipe it
across the surface of the solution, pressing it down with
the fingers of the other hand, with larger sizes it will
be well to cultivate a little trick in manipulation, and the
accompanying figure may perhaps be suggestive (Fig. 5),<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0217" id="p0217">217</a></span>
in which it will be seen the left hand is bringing one end
of the print into contact with the bath, whilst the right
hand holds the opposite end above and well back, and
the left hand will next be moved in the direction of the
arrow, drawing the print with it along the surface of the
bath, the right hand following but simultaneously lowering
the whole of the print&mdash;thus the solution attacks
the print smoothly and continuously, whilst the air
is pressed out in the opposite direction. Instantly the
entire print is floating on the bath it should be moved
about a little, as a further means of disengaging any
air bubbles.</p>

<p>As far as possible, prevent the developer from
flowing over the back of the print, but this will be a far
less evil than not bringing the whole printed surface
immediately and at one stroke on to the developer.
The print is next passed direct and without intermediate
washing into the hydrochloric acid bath, as already
described.</p>

<p>The sepia papers, S and RS, are both hot-bath
papers, and no special instructions need to be given as
regards development, except that to get the full benefit
of the sepia tint and secure a fine rich bright colour,
the Special Sepia Solution prepared and supplied by
the Platinotype Company should be employed in the
developer.</p>

<p>Of this, one or two drams should be added to each
ounce of oxalate bath, either before heating it in the
dish or afterwards and just before floating the prints.
In the latter case stir the whole so as to get it equally
mixed, and wipe the surface to remove any scum.</p>

<p>A good substitute for the bath as above prepared
for sepia prints may be made by adding one part of
saturated solution of oxalic acid to each ten parts of
oxalate of potash solution.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0218" id="p0218">218</a></span>

<p>The Sepia papers are rather more sensitive to light
than the Black papers, and hence all operations should
be conducted in very subdued daylight, a precaution
even extending to the first acid bath.</p>

<p>The bath containing the special solution should be used
for sepia prints only, and when done with kept in a
separate bottle for future use, but the bottle must be
kept from the light, and the sediment which will fall
should be left undisturbed at the bottom of the bottle or
filtered out, and the dish used for sepia development
should be well washed before using it for black
prints.</p>

<p>Opinions seem to differ as to the wisdom of keeping
old developing baths, but as far as my own experience
goes I use the oxalate solution for black prints again and
again, taking no heed of its discoloured condition.</p>

<p>After developing, the bath is poured into the stock
bottle, and so long as undissolved crystals remain at the
bottom of the bottle hot water may be added from time to
time to make up the loss occasioned by spilling and
waste, thus the stock solution is always a combination
of old and freshly-dissolved oxalate, and I have had one
large jar of solution thus in very frequent use for over
twelve months, a greenish-black encrustation gradually
accumulating at the bottom without detriment.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">CONCERNING THE HYDROCHLORIC CLEARING OR FIXING BATH.</p>

<p>Little needs to be said as to the Hydrochloric Acid
bath into which the prints are passed immediately after
development. The purpose of the acid bath is to dissolve
out the sensitive salts which have been unaffected by light
and which are still light-sensitive, the removal of these
making the paper white and clean. Thus the acid bath
is both fixing and clearing in its action.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0219" id="p0219">219</a></span>

<p>Into the first acid bath the prints will carry a good
deal of the oxalate solution in which they have been
developed, and it therefore soon becomes very much
discoloured, wherefore after a lapse of about five minutes
the print should be removed to a second acid bath of the
same strength as the first (pure hydrochloric acid 1 part,
water 70 parts) and after five or ten minutes into a third.</p>

<p>After the prints (many may be done at the same
time) have been in the third acid for five minutes, the
bath should be examined, and if it is quite colourless,
that is if the prints have not discoloured it at all, we may
rest satisfied that clearing and fixation are complete, but
if not, yet another acid bath should be given.</p>

<p>Whilst five or ten minutes in each acid bath is long
enough, probably no harm to the print itself, yet no good,
will follow a longer immersion. There may, however,
be a danger of softening or rotting the paper, a danger
which is increased should the bath be made stronger in acid.</p>

<p>If a number of prints are being made, or if numerous
dishes for acid constitute a difficulty or inconvenience,
we may modify procedure as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Make up the first acid bath to about half the prescribed
strength, say hydrochloric acid one part to water
120 to 140 parts. Into this each print may be flung as
soon as developed, until the entire batch is thus far
finished. In this weak acid bath the prints will take no
harm if left for several hours, when an acid bath (one to
seventy) of full strength having been prepared, the first
weak solution may be poured off and the fresh poured on.
In this the prints should be separately turned over, so
that each receives thorough treatment, when the second
bath may be thrown away and a third substituted.
One dish thus serves for the whole series of acid baths.</p>

<p>If adopting this course, it will be safer not to mix
sepia and ordinary black prints in the same <i>first</i> acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0220" id="p0220">220</a></span>
bath, after which, however, they may be treated
altogether.</p>

<p>Sufficient washing to rid the paper of acid is all that
is required to complete operations; but acid does not
cling to the print as does hypo, moreover, we have not
an absorbent gelatine surface to deal with, so that if
prints were dealt with individually and washed by hand,
probably a few minutes sluicing under a tap would
suffice, but in a properly constructed print-washer, or
even a large dish, twenty minutes to half-an-hour should
be ample. If any doubt is felt, the last washing water
may be tested with blue litmus paper.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">MODIFICATIONS IN DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>To impart a warmer and richer tone to prints on
CC (cold-bath) paper, the following slight modification
may be resorted to, but it must be regarded merely as
an exception for definite purposes, being in violation of
the instructions and rules already laid down. It consists
of developing CC paper as though it were hot-bath
paper, using a bath of about 170° F and submitting it to
the influence of damp to a slight degree. This latter
very heterodox course may be effected by leaving the
paper laid out all night in a room where there has been
no fire to dry the air, or by using paper which has been
kept for a week or so in its tube without calcium
chloride and without sealing the lid, or yet again, the
print may be held over the steam of the developer for a
few minutes before developing it.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that in doing this we are
taking liberties with the process, and if poor, "muddy"
prints result, we can only blame ourselves, but as a rule
this will not be the case, the effect being rather to
impart a slight creamy tone to the whites without otherwise
degrading their brilliance, whilst the use of a hot<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0221" id="p0221">221</a></span>
bath gives the whole a distinctly brown-black image,
which combined with the cream tint of the high-lights
has a very luminous and warm effect.</p>

<p>Another method of development which must also
be taken as an exceptional one, only to be used in
special cases to attain special ends, is local development
with a brush, using glycerine as a medium.</p>

<p>As may have been seen from the foregoing descriptions,
the development of a platinotype print, even with
a cold bath, is so rapid that there is not a possibility of
developing one portion more than another, or if such
could be done, still it would be done with the certainty
of leaving a mark where development had been stopped.
These difficulties, however, may be overcome by the
use of glycerine, the effect of which is to retard development
to almost any degree, and by its soft, viscid
character to soften and blend the line of demarcation
where greater or less development ceased. The method
of applying it is as follows: On removing the print
from the frame it should be fastened to a board with
pins, print side upwards. Next pour on to the surface
a small pool of <i>pure</i> glycerine, and with the finger tip, a
brush or soft pad, spread it <i>evenly</i> and thinly over the
print. It must not be allowed to remain on the surface
in irregular patches of unequal depth, but after spreading
it had better be wiped with a fresh pad of cotton wool,
so as to remove any superfluous glycerine. Now have
four small vessels at hand, and into No. 1 place an
ounce or two of the ordinary oxalate developing solution,
in No. 2 put equal parts of oxalate solution and glycerine,
in No. 3 one part oxalate solution and two parts glycerine,
and in No. 4 pure glycerine.</p>

<p>With a broad, soft hair brush apply the contents
of No. 3 to the less printed portions of the image and
wait results. These portions will presently begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0222" id="p0222">222</a></span>
gain in depth and to slowly develop up, now spread the
No. 3 mixture to the rest of the print and apply the contents
of No. 2 to the portions first treated with No. 3.
The most obstinate parts may be touched with No. 1,
plain oxalate solution, whilst any spots which have come
up too quickly may be promptly arrested from further
progress by the application of pure glycerine.</p>

<p>Here we have a method of developing up any one
part, and restraining or entirely stopping any other.</p>

<p>I do not think any good will be done by a more
detailed description of its working, even if there be anything
more to tell. It is essentially a method of development
in which the individual worker will invent modifications
and dodges for himself, and when all is said for
it, it must be admitted only as a means of improving a
subject when ordinary procedure fails.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">THE CHARACTER OF THE NEGATIVE FOR PLATINOTYPE.</p>

<p>In the earlier days of platinotype printing it was
generally insisted upon that the most suitable negatives
were such as we should describe as somewhat vigorous
or "plucky." Whether it is that some alteration has
been made in the manufacture of the paper or that taste
as regards what constitutes a good print has changed,
I cannot say. Certain it is that in the experience of a
good many, a "plucky" negative is by no means essential
to the production of a good platinotype print.</p>

<p>The soft, delicate negatives, of which the best
professional portrait negatives are a good sample, yield
the best possible results, whilst with the CC paper,
negatives so thin and delicate as to be suitable for hardly
any other printing process, give all that can be wished
for.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0223" id="p0223">223</a></span>

<p>Much, of course, will depend on the kind of print
desired and the paper used, and here it may be remarked
that from a given negative the different kinds of platinotype
paper give different results.</p>

<p>From a given negative the hot-bath papers yield
the greatest amount of half-tone, the hot development
tending to yield flatter results. Next comes the smooth,
cold-bath paper, and finally as yielding the maximum
amount of vigour is the CC paper. Hence if we make our
negatives specially for our chosen printing process, a
stronger negative will be needed for S, RS, A and C
than for the AA and CC, whilst for the latter a negative
distinctly erring on the side of extreme thinness will be
best.</p>

<p>If a negative gives prints which are too weak and flat
for our purpose, a great improvement may be effected
by printing through blue glass. If on the other hand
the prints are too hard and harsh in contrast, it is advisable
to print through "signal" green glass.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">TONING PLATINOTYPE PRINTS.</p>

<p>Several formula and methods have been published
from time to time, the object of which is to change the
colour of the platinotype print by subsequent staining or
toning, and whilst by such methods pleasing colours
may sometimes be obtained, they possess an element of
uncertainty, and must not be too much relied upon.
An exception in this respect must, however, be made
in the case of what is known as Packham's method, the
effect of which is to change the black platinotype to a
sepia brown, or a brown slightly tinged with green.
The necessary "tinctorial powder" must be obtained
from Mr. Packham or through a dealer. To prepare the
bath a packet of this powder is dissolved by boiling for
three or four minutes in five fluid ounces of water, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0224" id="p0224">224</a></span>
which when cold add one ounce methylated spirit. This
forms the stock solution and will keep for a long time if
well corked. For use add thirty or forty minims of the
stock solution to one pint of water, and in this steep the
prints, turning them over frequently. Toning may
occupy several hours. To expedite matters, the dilute
solution should be made with water of 150° F., and the
bath maintained at this temperature as in the case of
hot-bath development. As soon as the desired tint is
secured, remove the prints and wash well in three
changes of cold water.</p>

<p>Prints may be so treated at any time after they
have been made.</p>

<p>Glycerine developed prints are not suitable. Prints
must have been very thoroughly washed, so as to free
them from every trace of acid, also thoroughly fixed in
acid if they are to be "toned" by Packham's method.
If after "toning" and washing the whites of the print
appear to have suffered, the prints should be placed for
five or ten minutes in the following bath, which should
be kept at a temperature of 180° F.</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Castille soap</td>
		<td class="tdr">40</td>

</table>

<p>This will clear the whites and intensify the colour
generally.</p>

<p>Platinotypes may be toned to a red-brown by
uranium nitrate, or to a bluer colour with chloride of
gold. They may also be intensified by pyrogallic acid
or hydroquinone, but as the purpose of this article was
merely to give simple working instructions for platinotype
printing for the beginner, he may defer the consideration
of such side issues until he has become <i>au fait</i>
in the production of a good platinotype print.</p>

</div>

<div class="smallskip"></div>

<p>It is well to bear in mind
at the outset that bromide
paper is extremely
sensitive to light, almost as
much so as is a rapid dry
plate. For this reason, it
is obvious that it must not be
carelessly exposed to actinic
light. All manipulations
except the actual printing
must be conducted by red
or yellow light, such as is
allowed to pass through glass
of these colours.</p>

<p>For evenness of result, it
is better to use a lantern than
daylight, because the fluctuation
in intensity of the latter is
very misleading and liable to
lead to failures through over
or under development.</p>

<p>The actual colour of the light, also, is of far more
importance than one would suppose: ruby light tends to
give one the impression that development is complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0226" id="p0226">226</a></span>
long before that is the actual case; it is also somewhat
more difficult to handle the paper satisfactorily by this
light than by a good yellow.</p>

<p>For these and other reasons I strongly recommend
the use of yellow light, a thoroughly safe one being
given by gas or lamplight passing through one sheet of
yellow glass and one thickness of "canary medium."</p>

<p>This light, while being absolutely safe, gives such
perfect illumination that it is as easy to control and
estimate results as it would be by ordinary unfiltered
gaslight.</p>

<p>If a ruby glazed lantern is already in use for
negative work, it can readily be prepared for bromide
printing by merely removing the ruby glass and substituting
the yellow and canary medium. With these
brief hints as to illumination, let us consider the entire
process in its various stages.</p>

<p><i>Unpacking the Paper.</i>&mdash;The sensitive paper is generally
packed in envelopes sufficiently opaque to protect
it from the admission of light. The packet must be
opened in the dark-room from which <i>all</i> light (even stray
streaks beneath the door) is excluded, excepting only
that given by the yellow glazed lantern. The outer
envelope being carefully undone, an inner cover will be
found and these wrappers should be placed on a dry
table while a sheet of the paper is removed.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to have a "light-tight" box
(obtainable from any dealer) in which to put the paper
after unpacking it; this prevents loss of time and
awkwardness of handling in having to replace the paper
in its wrappers each time a piece is withdrawn for use.</p>

<p>When several prints from one or more negatives
are required, it is an excellent thing to have two of these
boxes, one for the unexposed paper and one in which to
put the prints as made until all are ready for development.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0227" id="p0227">227</a></span>

<p><i>The Class of Negative.</i>&mdash;Bromide paper gives us a
great command over results; in fact, so vast is the control
we may exercise that it is possible to secure good
results from almost all classes of negatives, from mere
ghosts to those with density almost equal to that of a
brick wall. But there is, of course, a class of negative
that gives a good result with the least expenditure of
skill, such a one is generally known as of average
density, having a full scale of gradation with high-lights
dense, yet not so opaque as to prevent you seeing a
window clearly defined when looking towards it <i>through</i>
the densest parts of the film, such as the sky, for
instance. Another way to test the density is to put the
negative, film side down, on some large print on white
paper, the large letters should be just visible through
the sky, but the smaller print should not be readable.</p>

<p>That is the class of negative usually considered in
Instructions for Use, as an "average" negative.</p>

<p><i>The Sensitive Side of the Paper.</i>&mdash;A difficulty sometimes
occurs in telling which is the sensitive side of the
paper: this may be easily ascertained by the appearance
of the edge, which turns slightly inwards <i>towards</i> the
sensitive side. This is quite apparent to the sense of
touch as well as sight. Some people moisten their
finger and thumb and squeeze the paper and see which
sticks (the sensitive side), but that is a dirty method and
quite unnecessary.</p>

<p><i>Printing from the Negative.</i>&mdash;Having unpacked the
paper, after making sure that all but the yellow (or ruby)
light has been excluded from the room, we are ready to
print.</p>

<p>For this purpose, different workers favour different
classes of light: one prefers gaslight, another swears by
magnesium ribbon, and some even prefer the light of
day.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0228" id="p0228">228</a></span>

<p>Personally, I favour ordinary gaslight passed
through a No. 5 Bray's burner, because it is quite rapid
enough for all practical purposes and is perfectly under
control and free from serious variation.</p>

<p>The burner should be within easy reach of the
worktable and should be fitted with a byepass to obviate
the necessity of continually striking matches. Several
years ago I had my bromide printing rooms fitted with
an excellent lantern of this class in which the byepass
was connected to two jets (one inside and the other outside
the lantern) in such a way as to turn down the
white light with the same movement that raised the
coloured light, and <i>vice versa</i>. By this means no gas
was wasted and the simple action of pulling or pushing
a lever operated either light at will. By placing the
same lever "amidships," both jets were lowered to the

time, yet always ready at a moment's notice. The
accompanying sketch (fig. 1) will give some idea of its
construction.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0229" id="p0229">229</a></span>

<p>If the dark-room is small, and space is an object,
the sink may be fitted with a wooden cover and this may
be used as a table for printing the paper, but care must
be observed to avoid the slightest moisture upon it or
satisfactory work is impossible and the negatives may
be ruined. In a large room, it is much better to have
an ordinary kitchen table removed some distance from
the sink; with this and a comfortable chair bromide
printing is a very pleasant occupation. The following
sketch (fig. 2) will explain the arrangement of the table,
and it applies equally well to the movable top of the sink.</p>

<div class="figcenter" title="Fig. 2.">

<p>Supposing that some arrangement of this sort is
devised, we must unpack some bromide paper and put
it in its box and then put a negative of "average"
density in an ordinary printing frame. On the film side
of the negative we must now place a sheet of bromide
paper with its sensitive side in contact, replace the back
of the frame and it is ready for exposure. Before
exposing it, <i>make sure that both boxes are shut</i> or their
contents will be ruined the moment the white light is
turned up.</p>

<p>Upon reference to the instructions that accompany
each packet of bromide paper, you will observe a certain
number of seconds' exposure is advised at a certain
distance from the light; in the case of the Barnet extra<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0230" id="p0230">230</a></span>
rapid paper the time is given as about four seconds at a
distance of eighteen inches.</p>

<p>When all is ready for exposure, place the printing
frame upright opposite the lantern at the mark indicating
eighteen inches (see <a href="#cp0229">fig. 2</a>), note the time on the seconds
hand of the clock and throw the lever over for white
light for four seconds and then reverse it. Remove the
paper and if many are likely to be required from that
negative, it would be well to develop the first print in
order to judge as to the accuracy of the exposure. If
over or under-exposed, the time must be reduced or
lengthened as required. When the best time and distance
has been ascertained for a certain negative, mark
it with a narrow strip of paper bearing full particulars
for future guidance, such as: "4 sec., 18 in., No. 5
Bray;" in this way absolute correctness of future exposures
is assured. Of course, if gas is not obtainable,
magnesium ribbon may be used instead. In this case
the negative would be marked "1 inch (or more) ribbon,
3 ft. distant," as the case may be.</p>

<p><i>Using Masks and Discs.</i>&mdash;Prints are sometimes
required with an oval (or square) centre and white
margins: this is effected by interposing a black mask of
the desired size and shape (obtainable from all dealers)
between the negative and the sensitive paper. The black
paper prevents the passage of light and leaves white
margins to the print. If grey margins are required, a
disc (to fit the mask) is attached to a sheet of glass the
same size as the negative and arranged so that registration
is easily effected; the print is first made with a
mask and is then placed in contact with the disc and
plain glass (the negative being removed from the frame),
and again exposed for a second to the light. If a black
border is required the exposure of the margin must be
extended three or four seconds.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0231" id="p0231">231</a></span>

<p><i>Vignetting.</i>&mdash;To vignette bromide prints, the printing
frame must be covered with a piece of cardboard
in which a small hole (about 1&frac12; inches by 1 inch
for a cabinet head and bust) is pierced. The hole <i>must</i>
be covered with a sheet of white tissue paper which
will diffuse the light and cause it to travel without harsh
lines beneath the opening, and make the print with perfectly
gradated edges. It is sometimes an advantage
to move the negative while printing vignettes; but
it is not absolutely essential if the hole in the cardboard
is not too large and if the card is removed some
little distance from the negative. If the card is too close
to the negative, the gradation will be abrupt and the
vignette will not look well.</p>

<p><i>Cloud Printing.</i>&mdash;This requires some care in order
to avoid harshness and sharply defined lines. If the sky
of the negative prints white, the addition of clouds from
another negative is not difficult; but if it is at all thin,
the entire sky must be carefully painted out with a
deeply opaque pigment in order to make it quite dense
and unprintable.</p>

<p>As a bromide print cannot be examined while in
progress: that is, cannot be seen at all before development,
careful registration is desirable in order to prevent
printing the clouds across the landscape instead of above
it. To do this an opaque mask should be made thus:
Make a print from the negative on P.O.P. and, without
fixing or toning it, cut it carefully in two parts following
the horizon line as nearly as possible, then expose to
light, until quite black, that part representing the landscape.
Attach this to the glass side of the cloud
negative (with the paper side of the P.O.P. in contact)
and see that the bottom edge and the right corner of the
paper and glass (viewed from the glass side of the
negative) exactly coincide. To make use of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0232" id="p0232">232</a></span>
arrangement, you first make a print from the landscape
negative, making sure that the negative and paper are
firmly pressed against the bottom and left-hand side of
the printing frame when looking towards the film side of
the negative; mark the registered corner with lead
pencil thus =L= in order to prevent mistakes in the second
printing.</p>

<p>To print the clouds, you put the negative in the
frame and press it well home to the left-hand corner
and the base of frame (looking at the film side, of
course), and then put the print in contact with the same
precaution and replace the back. Now take a piece of
brown paper with one edge roughly torn in shape of the
horizon line of the mask and cover the entire negative
on the glass side. Hold the covered frame in your
hands at a distance of (say) four feet from the gas and
turn on the white light. Directly the light is up, draw
the paper slowly downwards until the horizon line is
just passed, and then <i>immediately</i> begin to slowly push it
upwards towards the top of the sky. Do this steadily
and slowly for (say) four to six seconds, according to the
density of the cloud negative. With a good thin cloud,
four seconds should be quite enough, but you can easily
settle this point on developing the first print.</p>

<p><i>Printing from Dense Negatives.</i>&mdash;Dense negatives
require much longer exposures than those of "average"
(or ideal) density. This may often be prolonged to
twice or three times the normal exposure at the same
distance. A yellow coloured negative increases the
exposure greatly, as much as ten to thirty times the
normal frequently being requisite to get a decent print.
An over dense negative that gives very harsh prints
by other printing processes can be made to yield prints
of exquisite softness on bromide paper by giving a full
exposure at a <i>short</i> distance from the gas.</p>

<p><i>Printing from Thin Negatives.</i>&mdash;Thin negatives on
the other hand, require quite different treatment. In
order to get plucky prints from very thin negatives,
useless in other processes, we must give a very brief
exposure at some distance from the gas; and here it
may be well to note that removing the negative to a
greater distance from the light is equal to decreasing the
actual time of exposure and has other advantages in
connection with thin negatives with which theory does
not seem to agree. To print from a very thin negative,
then, instead of four seconds at eighteen inches, let us
cover it with a sheet of tissue paper and give it four seconds
at a distance of three or four feet and note the result on
development. If it appears to be over-exposed, we may
reduce the time of exposure to three seconds at the same
distance and modify the developer, as will be explained
later on.</p>

<p><i>Development of Prints.</i>&mdash;All my remarks in this
article apply equally to most commercial brands of
bromide paper; but it is only fair to state that they are
particularly intended for that made by the firm of manufacturers
publishing this book. Development, and so
on, is very similar with all makes of paper, but most of
my recent experiments have been made on the
"Barnet" matt surface bromide.</p>

<p>I shall presently describe the use of several well-known
developers, but it must be well understood that,
whatever formula is adopted, a preliminary soaking of
the print before development must be done.</p>

<p>When we are about to develop a number of
prints we must first soak them in plain cold water until
quite flaccid, otherwise the application of the developer
would cause the dry print to cockle and curl, and the
development would not be regular. This rule applies
equally in the case of one print only as when a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0234" id="p0234">234</a></span>
are ready for development; a prolonged soaking in plain
water having no ill effect.</p>

<p><i>The Iron Developer.</i>&mdash;This is one of the developers
most frequently recommended for bromide work, but
personally I never advise its use (especially by a novice)
because the use of the acid clearing bath, which is an
essential part of the process, is so frequent a cause of
disaster and yellow prints. The Barnet formula is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Hot water</td>
		<td class="tdr">32</td>
		<td class="tdl">ozs.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>To six ounces of A, add one ounce of B; this order of
mixing must be observed or a dense precipitate of ferrous
oxalate will be formed.</p>

<p>Place one of the soaked prints face (which may be
distinguished by its "slippery" surface) upwards in a
clean porcelain dish and pour the developer over it as
evenly as possible. With this developer, the image
comes up very rapidly, so that it is not advisable to try
and develop more than one at a time. If the first
print of a batch appears to be over-exposed, that is, if
it flashes out instantly and the high-lights become rapidly
clouded, add to each ounce of mixed developer from 10
to 30 drops of a ten per cent. solution of potassium
bromide which will act as a restrainer, retard development,
and keep the high-lights clear while the shadows
acquire density. Under-exposed prints can rarely be
made to give passable results with ferrous oxalate. The
addition of a trace of hypo to the developer has been
recommended for bringing up their detail, but the result
is far from good.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0235" id="p0235">235</a></span>

<p>As soon as development is complete the prints must
<i>not</i> be put in clean water, but must be transferred direct
from the developer to the following acid bath:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Acetic acid</td>
		<td class="tdr">1</td>
		<td class="tdl">dram.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">32</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>After an immersion of one minute, the operation must be
twice repeated in similar baths that have not been
previously used; this is to remove the iron from the
print. A thorough washing must next be given to
remove the acid and the print may then be fixed for at
least fifteen minutes in</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Hypo</td>
		<td class="tdr">2</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">20</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>After fixing (no matter what developer has been used)
the prints must be thoroughly washed in several changes
of water for at least two hours.</p>

<p>The chief reasons against the use of ferrous oxalate
are lack of control over development and the necessary
use of an acid bath. Unless the acid bath is used, the
prints will be yellow because of the iron in them, and if
the acid is not entirely removed before fixing the prints
will be yellow owing to the decomposition of the hypo
by the acid in the print which causes deposition of
sulphur.</p>

<p><i>Metol Developer.</i>&mdash;With this, and the other developers
I shall mention, an acid bath is not necessary and so one
cause of failure (and extra work) is obviated. I have
somewhat amended the Barnet formula to meet the
needs of workers on a small scale and have also arranged
A and B to balance each other without disturbing the
relative proportions of the ingredients.</p>

<p>to stop development. When all are developed, they
must be rinsed for a minute or two in clean water and
then fixed. Over-exposure is remedied by the addition
of potassium bromide solution (as in the case of ferrous
oxalate); under-exposed prints should be developed in a
weak solution such as</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

<p>Development will take longer, but the weaker solution
will help to bring up the detail without the harshness of
the shadows that would be the case if the normal
developer was used.</p>

<p><i>Hydroquinone and Eikonogen.</i>&mdash;The advantage of combining
eikonogen with quinol lies in the fact that one
provides what the other lacks, the eikonogen tending to
give detail without density and the quinol (in inexperienced
hands) giving density without detail. The
following formula will be found very satisfactory:&mdash;</p>

<p>For use, mix one part of A, one part of B and two parts
of water. The same remarks as to over and under-exposure
apply as in the case of metol.</p>

<p><i>Toning Bromide Prints.</i>&mdash;The "tone" or colour of the
deposit depends largely upon the accuracy of exposure
and the developer employed. Ferrous oxalate gives a
rich black deposit, but to my mind metol and the combined
eiko-quinol give tones at least as beautiful with
pretty gray half-tones.</p>

<p>But some people prefer warmer colours, brown and
red for instance, and some get brownish blacks (through
over-exposure and the use of bromide) which they would
like to change.</p>

<p>The colour of the deposit may be changed in various
ways by treating the print in baths of different metals.
I will give a brief outline of the methods employed,
leaving readers to modify them to suit each particular
case.</p>

<p><i>Black and Blue-black Tone.</i>&mdash;Brownish black prints
can be much improved after fixing by immersion in a
strong bath of gold chloride; the following is the strength
used by me:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdc" colspan="3">A.</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Ammonium sulphocyanide</td>

	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">1</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounce.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>When quite dissolved add B very gradually to A,
shaking almost continuously. The fixed print should be
washed for at least fifteen minutes before toning and
should then be placed in a clean tray while the toning
bath is poured over it. The solution must be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0238" id="p0238">238</a></span>
moving and the print must be removed and washed
directly the desired tone is reached. Prolonged immersion
will cause the print to acquire a deep blue tone.</p>

<p><i>Brown and Red Tones with Uranium.</i>&mdash;Prints immersed
in the uranium toning bath gradually become warmer in
tone, changing from black to brown and brownish red
until they assume a deep red nearly approaching the
well-known Bartollozzi chalk.</p>

<p>Prints to be toned by this process must be <i>thoroughly</i>
free from hypo or stains will be the inevitable result.
The toning bath should be made up as follows, and it
must be used at once as it will not keep after mixing A
and B:&mdash;</p>

<p>Immerse the print and keep the solution in motion until
the desired colour is produced, then wash the print for
half an hour in several changes of water acidulated
(1 dram in 30 ounces) with acetic acid. Weak, under-developed
prints are much improved by this method of
toning.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour, if the whites are at all
yellow they may be cleared by immersing the print for a
minute or two in the following bath:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Ammonium sulphocyanide</td>

		<td class="tdr">10</td>
		<td class="tdl">ounces.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>After immersion, rinse the print for five minutes and dry.</p>

<p><i>Intensification.</i>&mdash;It sometimes happens (especially
when too little light has been used to properly judge
development) that one acquires a collection of prints
that, owing to under or over-development, are useless;
let us see how they may be rendered serviceable.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0239" id="p0239">239</a></span>

<p>An under-developed print, though weakly looking
and "washed out," simply needs intensification to give
it the requisite pluck. The foregoing uranium bath acts
as an intensifier while conferring a ruddy tone on the
deposit. A black deposit can be obtained by intensifying
the well-washed print with mercury. The print must
first be immersed in a saturated solution of mercuric
chloride until the image disappears; it must then be
again thoroughly washed to remove all traces of free
mercury and may then be redeveloped by flowing over
it an old ferrous-oxalate developer. If ferrous oxalate is
not at hand, an old metol developer may be substituted,
but the former is the more reliable.</p>

<p>When the image is sufficiently intense, the print
must once more be thoroughly washed. All the toning
and intensifying operations may be conducted by daylight.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of Density.</i>&mdash;Over dense prints can be
made fit for many purposes by means of a "reducer"

<p>The print to be reduced need not be free from hypo,
but should be rinsed for a few minutes after fixing (or
soaked until limp, if previously dried) and may then be
placed in a tray and flooded with the reducer. The tray<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0240" id="p0240">240</a></span>
must be well rocked and the print, when sufficiently
reduced, must be removed without delay and rapidly
washed in running water.</p>

<p><i>Some Cheap and Useful Trays.</i>&mdash;If large-sized prints
are made, the cost of suitable trays becomes a very
serious item. The expense of these may be reduced to
a mere nothing, without loss of effectiveness, by the
substitution of home-made ones. All that is required to
make a tray of any size is a thin wooden confectionery
box (or the bottom part of a larger case) lined with the
shiny white marbled oilcloth known as "American moleskin."
This is fitted inside the box (the corners being
turned under) and secured by a row of tacks around the
top edge. No further lining or preparation is required
and the tray will stand all sorts of ill-treatment. As for
durability: I had three such trays made out of old
herring-boxes picked up at Calgary and lined with moleskin
that had already seen service as cover to a wash-handstand
and chest of drawers in a Canadian boardinghouse.
For upwards of a year those trays were used
daily and travelled many hundreds of miles by mule and
dog train, and were not worn out when I returned home.
My porcelain trays were smashed by a fall from a
refractory mule, but the rough and ready makeshifts
were a priceless boon.</p>

<p>It seems to me that by practising economy of this
kind and in various similar ways (<i>i.e.</i>, where economy is
necessary as, unfortunately, it sometimes is) the cost of
practising our pet recreation is very materially reduced.</p>

<p>Pictorial photography
is answerable
for the revival of this, one
of the almost forgotten
methods of printing. Results
unacceptable to bygone
requirements have been reintroduced
with advantage,
where suggestive individuality
and artistic effect have
been desired.</p>

<p>The gum process has
an unlimited range of possibilities,
it would be impossible
to describe them
all. The minutest details,
or the broadest diffusion
together with the power of
working from the highest to
the lowest keys of <i>chiaroscuro</i>
are values that can only be
realized when the infatuation
consequent on successfully working the process is
experienced.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0242" id="p0242">242</a></span>

<p>This method of printing, as with the so-called "carbon
process," is dependent upon the characteristic behaviour
of the chromic salts when in combination with organic
substances, such as gelatine, gums of various kinds,
starch, etc.</p>

<p>When any of these mixtures are submitted to the
action of actinic light, they become more or less insoluble.</p>

<p>This property was partially discovered as far back
as 1798, by Vauquelin. Professor Sucrow, Mungo
Ponton, Beauregard and others advanced its application
to photography up to about 1840, but it was not until
some ten years later that its great value as a photographic
agent was definitely established.</p>

<p>Hunt, Fox Talbot and Poitevin, each worked
indefatigably to bring the application of the chromic
process to a successful issue; but to Poitevin must be
accredited the honour of being the original inventor of
the chromated pigment or carbon process. This brings
us up to about 1855.</p>

<p>None of these investigators appear to have been
remarkably successful, beyond having established
definite, but valuable facts of the changes produced.</p>

<p>This want of success may possibly be accounted
for by the general employment of gelatine and direct
printing. It was not until Pouncey and others, about
1859, employed gum as the colloid medium, that any
great advance was made.</p>

<p>About this time an important commission of inquiry
decided that to Pouncey, Gamier and Salmon, and
Beauregard the honour of producing permanent prints
must be equally credited, and accordingly divided the
Duc de Luyue's prize between them, giving to Poitevin
the credit of the priority of invention.</p>

<p>Pouncey appears to have followed up the process
with some considerable success, as some of his existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0243" id="p0243">243</a></span>
examples are excellent; it is much to be regretted that
we have not more detailed particulars of his methods of
working; but he evidently was before his time and met
with but little encouragement.</p>

<p>To Alfred Maskell and M. Demachy must be
accredited the revival of this long neglected process, and
during the last three years much advancement has been
made towards perfecting it.</p>

<p>Serious workers, both at home and abroad, are
industriously exhausting the possibilities of the process,
and crude as some of the earlier examples of this
revival have been, improvements and simplicity of
working are giving us productions of every description,
of such excellent quality that it may soon be expected
to satisfy even the caustic criticism that has so persistently
opposed its re-introduction.</p>

<p>Dexterity in the various stages of practical manipulation
is necessary before skilful efficiency can be
secured, and in order to arrive at this, due consideration
must be given to the selection of the paper the colour
most suitable to the subject and the effect desired.</p>

<p>Almost any kind of paper will be found workable,
if it be of fairly good quality. Those that are thickly
coated with soluble sizing media are unsuitable, for
although they may give clear whites they sometimes
produce harsh prints, the half-tones are also liable to be
lost in development unless very deeply printed. Several
of the continental kinds are well adapted to the process
and work in an excellent manner, giving soft and even
results; of course, it will be understood that for definition
and fine detail the finer grained descriptions are the
best, but where diffusion is desired those of a coarser
texture may be advantageously used, they give a granulation
that tends materially to secure the peculiarities of
gradation characteristic of this process.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0244" id="p0244">244</a></span>

<p>A few of the continental papers that will be found
to work with ease to the beginner, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Michallet paper is rather coarse, but takes the gum
coating easily, it has a series of lines running in both
directions, which are rather objectionable for some
subjects; but it is an excellent paper for first
experiments.</p>

<p>Ingrés, is also a paper of similar character, and can
be worked with equal facility. Lallane is another paper
of the same class, but much finer.</p>

<p>Allongé paper is entirely free from the markings
peculiar to those previously mentioned. This paper is
best worked on the reverse side, which can be distinguished
by examining the name marked in one
corner.</p>

<p>Among the English papers the ordinary cartridge,
Whatman's drawing papers and many others are adaptable,
but it must be borne in mind that those with a
toothed or grained surface are preferable.</p>

<p>There are two methods of working, and results of
equal excellence have been produced by either. Some
of the most proficient workers of the process adopt the
easier one of coating the paper, without previous preparation,
with a mixture of gum, bichromate of potass
and pigment. Others adopt the precaution of first
saturating the paper with a strong solution of bichromate,
and when dry coating it with a mixture containing only
gum and pigment.</p>

<p>Experience is in favour of the previous saturation
of the paper, this is recommended especially for
beginners, as there are several kinds of paper that will
not work efficiently by the first method; but when skill
and practical knowledge of the special behaviour of the
materials employed is acquired, either method can be
adopted.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0245" id="p0245">245</a></span>

<p>We may presume that the advantage of the previous
saturation of the paper with the chromic salt is,
that should there be any inequality in its structural
character, or should it be unequally sized, the bichromate
appears to act as a kind of resist to the penetration
of the pigment, thereby securing an increased range of
tone and a corresponding purity of the whites.</p>

<p>The process may be divided into the following
operations:&mdash;</p>

<table style="margin-left: 5em;" summary="process">
	<tr><td class="tdl">Saturation or sensitizing of the paper.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="tdl">Preparation of the gum mucilage.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="tdl">Mixing and preparing the pigments.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="tdl">Coating the paper.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="tdl">Printing and exposure.</td></tr>
	<tr><td class="tdl">Development.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For working by the previously chromated paper
method, the sensitizing solution is made up of one part
of bichromate of potassium dissolved in ten parts of
water. This strength will not keep at all temperatures.
Should the salt crystallize out, it is necessary to warm a
portion of the solution and re-dissolve the crystals. The
solution may be used repeatedly, but it will be necessary
to filter it occasionally.</p>

<p>Before saturation it is convenient to cut the
paper into the most useful sizes&mdash;quarter sheets are
handy. Having decided which is to be the working
side, mark the back distinctly. Into a dish of sufficient
depth pour in the one in ten bichromate solution to a
depth of about one inch, and immerse your paper sheet
by sheet, until you have in it all you intend to sensitize.
As each sheet is placed in the solution, remove air
bells and turn it over and repeat this precaution. The
time necessary for immersion is of no importance so
that the saturation is absolute, about five minutes being
generally sufficient for the thickest of papers. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0246" id="p0246">246</a></span>
removing the bottom sheet to the top and passing
through the whole in this manner, turning over each
sheet and removing all air bells, even saturation is
secured. Each sheet is carefully and slowly removed
from the solution and dried in the dark. The paper is
now very sensitive to actinic light, which must during
all future operations be carefully guarded against.</p>

<p>After the paper is dry, it will&mdash;if kept so&mdash;be in
good condition for a long time.</p>

<p>To prepare the gum mucilage, take two ounces of
Soudan or Turkey gum and dissolve it in five fluid ounces
of cold water, strain out the floating impurities through
fine muslin, and allow others, and finer to subside. This
mucilage will keep in good condition in a well-corked
bottle, for a considerable time. M. Demachy employs
gum mucilage of twice this density.</p>

<p>Pigments in powder are more suitable than in any
other form, if in cakes or paste. The medium in which
they are prepared, does not work kindly with the gum,
and it is also difficult to accurately measure quantities.
No advantage is gained by using expensive colours,
they can all be purchased at a good colourman's, and at
a small cost.</p>

<p>Lamp or any carbon, black, red ochre, yellow ochre,
burnt sienna, and raw sienna, all work well; there is some
uncertainty with the umbers and sepias. It will be
found that much time will be saved if a combination of
these dry colours is made up in bulk, as for instance&mdash;one
hundred and seventy-five grains of vegetable black
and one hundred of burnt sienna, give a rich soft brown
colour. These must be finely and intimately mixed with
each other, which is conveniently accomplished by
grinding with a small pestle and mortar; after which the
mixture may be kept in a wide-mouthed bottle. Another
advantage in thus keeping combinations of dry colours in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0247" id="p0247">247</a></span>
bulk, is the absolute certainty of repeating the actual
tint when required.</p>

<p>Various combinations of similar mixtures can be
made. Of course it will be understood that any or all
of the above-named colours may be used singly.</p>

<p>The grinding of the pigment with the mucilage is
easily done on a stone slab with a palette knife. Take
half a fluid ounce of the two in five gum mucilage, to
which add the same quantity of water and thoroughly
mix. Weigh out fifteen grains of the mixed pigment and
place in a heap on the slab, add a few drops of the diluted
mucilage, grind and regrind the mixture until it is completely
smooth, then remove it to a cup, and clean the
stone with another portion of the reduced mucilage,
finally adding the whole of the ounce, intimately mix,
and it is then ready for coating the paper.</p>

<p>For extra fine work on smooth paper, and in fact
for all classes of work, the fine grinding of the colours
adds materially to extend the range of gradation, and
although the trituration may be carried out fairly well
with a palette knife, when the finest possible grades are
desired, recourse must be had to the muller and stone.
Mullers are obtainable of any artist's colourman, they are
made in glass, and a convenient size is about one inch
in diameter.</p>

<p>The most convenient brush for applying the mixture
of combined gum and pigment to the paper, is of the
description known as bear's hair, these are usually set
in tin; a flat one about two inches wide is a useful size.</p>

<p>In order to coat the paper evenly, pin it down to a
drawing board by each corner with a double layer of
blotting paper an inch or two larger than the paper to be
coated. The blotting paper will absorb the excess of
colour at the margins and enable you to secure an even
coating up to the extreme edge.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0248" id="p0248">248</a></span>

<p>Take a fairly full brush of the mixture after
thoroughly incorporating the colour and spread it evenly
over the paper, crossing and recrossing it with the
brush. Allow the mixture to lie upon the paper for a
second or two so that the paper may expand; now
release each of the corners and pin the paper down again.
Upon the next operation depends the evenness of the
coating.</p>

<p>Take a four inch wide artist's badger's hair softener,
hold it vertically and lightly by two fingers and the
thumb about an inch and a half from the top of the
handle, and pass it rapidly over the whole surface of the
paper as quickly and evenly as possible. The motion
producing the best effect is not the usual sweeping
action, but a series of sudden short jerks, difficult to
describe but easily acquired. Continue this softening
down until the paper has an even semi-transparent
surface without uneven cloudy spots. Allow it to dry
spontaneously, but before it is stored for future use dry
it carefully by the fire, but avoid overheating.</p>

<p>Uncertainty of result is a defect often brought into
argument against this process; but absolute uniformity
is not difficult if strictly accurate quantities only are
employed. With constant strength of bichromate and
gum, uniform weights and combination of pigment,
similarity of repeats are obtained: but these can only be
secured when each sheet of paper is coated identically
with its fellow. To get this evenness the badger hair
softener must be washed out and dried after coating each
sheet. This is very quickly accomplished by an energetic
shaking and drying upon a smooth towel. If the
paper has been coated properly, it has an even semi-transparent
surface slightly glassy.</p>

<p>Failures often occur from using an excess of pigment
and allowing the gum to become too thick in<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0249" id="p0249">249</a></span>
consequence of evaporation. Excess of pigment gives
dense heavy shadows and increases the difficulty of
printing; excess of gum gives clear high-lights, tending
to hardness and easy solubility endangering the half-tones.</p>

<p>The paper, if it has been correctly coated will work
satisfactorily, if on steeping a small piece of it downwards
upon cold water, the pigmented gum dissolves
and drops from the surface leaving the paper nearly
clean. From ten to fifteen minutes should complete
this test.</p>

<p>The method of working without previously chromatizing
the paper is as follows:&mdash;Take half a fluid ounce
of four-in-ten gum mucilage and add to it an equal
quantity of saturated solution of bichromate of potass;
to this, with all care as to grinding and mixing, add the
pigment; coat the paper as before directed. This
method will be considerably slower in printing than that
in which the paper had been previously saturated with
the bichromate; neither are the whites as a rule quite
so clear; but it will possess a peculiar grain and softness
not otherwise obtainable, which is much approved by
some workers of the process.</p>

<p>Exposure is so much dependent on circumstances
that it is difficult to give precise directions, being
governed by the density of the negative, the thickness
of the coating and the intensity of the light. Even and
not too dense negatives are the more suitable, for if the
intermediate and high-lights are over dense the shadows
are considerably over printed before the lighter parts
can be brought out. Skill in development can do
much to overcome these defects, but they may be
considerably modified by the judicious employment of
matt varnish, and by other methods of locally retarding
printing.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0250" id="p0250">250</a></span>

<p>The greatest assistance in obtaining uniformity in
printing is the employment of a reliable actinometer,
Wynne's print meter is probably the most useful for
this purpose, with ordinary gelatino-chloride paper as a
register; from twelve to sixteen numbers will be mostly
sufficient for an ordinary negative, on not too thickly
coated paper. Another method of judging exposure
is by the appearance of the shadows; they may
frequently be seen by transmitted light, and when well
out printing may be judged to be correct, but this
is a slovenly method and only approximately correct
at the best.</p>

<p>If the bichromate is used only in the pigmented
gum, without previous saturation of the paper, exposure
must be much more prolonged.</p>

<p>By no other process is it possible to obtain such
diversity of effect as by this; much will, however,
depend on the skill which is exercised in development.
Should the printing exposure have been fairly correct it
is a simple procedure. The print is floated face downward
upon cold water contained in a deep dish; see that
all parts are equally acted upon by the water, and that
no air bells exist; if any, they may be easily removed
by gently raising the print and immersing it again once
or twice. After it has been soaking some five or ten
minutes it may be examined; if all is going well, and
the exposure has been approximately correct, the pigmented
gum on the unexposed margins will have left
the paper, and possibly some of the high-lights and
half-tones may be making an appearance, if so, the
treatment must be of a gentle character, and the print
may be safely left for some time longer in the same
position face downward; never allow it to lie either in
or out of the water face upwards for any long time,
or unremovable stains will be developed. Many prints<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0251" id="p0251">251</a></span>
will develop almost entirely without assistance, or with
only an occasional laving of water if allowed to lie in
this position for a long time. On the other hand some
may, even when only slightly over-printed, give no indication
of development. When this is the case remove
the print from the water and place it face upwards upon
a thin, smooth board, fix it in position with one drawing
pin on the extreme margin, then gently lave cold water
over it; should some of the darker parts still resist this
action, longer soaking will be found advantageous. If
there are still parts on which the colour will not move,
recourse must be had to the brush, and for this purpose
nothing is better than a large camel's hair mop.
Keeping the brush always full of water, touch where
necessary very softly; do not sweep it up or down,
but just dab here and there as may be required,
constantly flowing over the surface a copious supply
of water.</p>

<p>If there are still parts in the shadows, or even in
the high-lights that will not move, a jet of water from
an enema syringe or from the household service pipe is
very useful.</p>

<p>As a last resource a prolonged steeping in water
of varying degrees of temperature, even up to the
boiling point, may be resorted to, but the application
of increased temperature requires judicious management.</p>

<p>When the print is sufficiently developed, if the
creamy yellowness of the chromate stain is not desired,
the print must be cleared or bleached, either in a solution
of alum, sulphite of soda, or hyposulphite of soda,
strength being immaterial with a careful after-washing.
If the print is only just sufficient or only slightly over-printed,
care must be taken that the clearing bath is not
acid, neither must the washing be too prolonged, but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0252" id="p0252">252</a></span>
the print is first dried and submitted to light, this precaution
is unnecessary.</p>

<p>Always allow the prints to dry spontaneously.
It will not do to use any kind of pressure or blotting
paper, for the surface of the colour is very tender and
delicate.</p>

<p>In the article that follows
next will be found a
complete exposition of the
carbon process, with its
various adaptations from the
preparation of the paper and
material forwards.</p>

<p>Whilst at the present
time carbon printing is more
largely used by professional
photographers, yet its simplicity,
the absence of
chemical formulæ and complications
combined with the
beauty of the results, makes
it eminently suitable for
amateur workers, and hence
it has been thought desirable
that as an introduction
to the subsequent article, a
brief and simple outline of
the process should be given
for the benefit of those who have not hitherto made
its acquaintance.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0254" id="p0254">254</a></span>

<p>In the first place then let it be understood that in
carbon printing instead of depending on light to make a
visible alteration of the sensitive salts as in silver
printing, we expose the prepared paper or "tissue," as it
is called, under a negative and secure a positive in
insoluble gelatine, the gelatine having combined with it
a pigment, and hence we get an image in pigment, not
in platinum, or silver, or gold, but in a simple pigment
which may be of any colour.</p>

<p>If bichromate of potash is mixed with an organic
substance such as gelatine, that gelatine becomes
insoluble after exposure to light, and if that gelatine
carries with it a pigment, then on becoming insoluble it
holds the pigment with it. If now, paper or other
material be coated with bichromate, gelatine, and pigment,
and exposed to light under a negative in the
usual way, the thin portions of the negative will admit
of the light acting on this coating and making it insoluble,
whilst the parts which are protected from light, as for
instance the sky or white objects, will remain unchanged
and soluble, and on being washed in water will dissolve
away, leaving white paper, whilst the light-affected
portions which have become insoluble remain in proportion
as the light has penetrated the various densities
of the negative. This then is how we obtain our print.</p>

<p>For fuller explanation of the paper or "tissue" and
its manufacture the reader is referred to the next article.</p>

<p>The beginner will certainly first obtain his tissue
ready made, and he can purchase it ready sensitized or
otherwise. The former will be best at the outset, but it
must be borne in mind that it should not be kept longer
than can be helped before use, and never more than ten
to fourteen days at the utmost. Various shades of
blacks, browns, and reds are the usual colours, also grey,
green, and blue. The tissue is rather more sensitive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0255" id="p0255">255</a></span>
light than silver paper, and should therefore be opened
and handled in subdued light. It must be kept as dry
as possible. A rather vigorous negative is best for
carbon printing, one not too strong in contrasts. Before
placing the negative in the frame, we must give it what
is termed a "safe edge." This is done by making a
narrow border, say of about a quarter of an inch or less,
round the negative, either on the glass or film side, with
opaque black varnish, or it may be done by gumming
on narrow strips of paper, such as lantern-slide binders.
If binders and not black varnish are used, they must be
applied to the glass side.</p>

<p>The Carbon printing paper which will hereinafter
be called the "tissue" will be found to present an unpromising
appearance, and as the coating is the full colour
of the pigment in which the print is eventually to appear, it
follows that the progress of printing will not be visible,
and a mechanical means of gauging the exposure must
be resorted to. An actinometer, similar to that described
in the article on Platinotype, will do, and another and
simpler form is described in the next article.</p>

<p>Printing will occupy about one-third of the time
occupied by gelatino-chloride of silver paper.</p>

<p>Development is conducted in daylight, but not too
close to a window.</p>

<p>The absence of chemical solutions has been suggested
as an advantage, in this process the developer being
merely hot water.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to have this laid on, a can of hot
water close at hand and a kettle on the fire or gas stove
not far off are all that are required.</p>

<p>We shall require four or five dishes, one at least of
which should be a good deal larger than the size of the
prints we are to develop and several inches deep&mdash;a
good-sized pie-dish or a basin will do.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0256" id="p0256">256</a></span>

<p>Development merely consists of washing away the
unaffected and therefore soluble coating, but it must be
remembered that the less affected portions representing
the half-tones have received their modicum of light on
the surface, and therefore the soluble part of the film is
underneath the part that has like a surface skin become
insoluble. This necessitates the printed film or tissue
being transferred to another paper or "support," so that
we may develop or wash away from the back.</p>

<p>In procuring your carbon tissue order at the same
time a packet of Single Transfer Paper, which is paper
with a thin coating of hard gelatine. Now to proceed.
Place a piece of single transfer paper into a dish of cold
water, and in three or four minutes the coated side will
feel slimy, then place in the same dish a piece of the
printed tissue face upwards. This will probably curl
up at first and afterwards flatten out again. When this
has happened or in a few minutes after immersion bring
the piece of single transfer paper and the print together,
film to film, so that they may be in contact, and square
one with the other. Now holding them by one edge,
withdraw them together by sliding them out of the dish
on to a sheet of thick glass, a large cutting glass serves
well, or stout sheet of zinc.</p>

<p>This should be supported in readiness at the rim of
the dish.</p>

<p>Having the transfer paper and print now on the
glass or zinc, hold them firmly and with a rubber
squeegee press them closely into contact, squeezing as
much water out as possible.</p>

<p>A better way perhaps is, if the dish is large enough,
to place the glass or zinc under the two papers whilst in
the water and so raise them out.</p>

<p>The squeegeeing must be done thoroughly, firmly, and
all over&mdash;several strokes being given in each direction.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0257" id="p0257">257</a></span>

<p>Next lift the papers, now in firm contact and
sticking together, and place them between blotting paper
on which is a heavy weight. The next print may now
be proceeded with and so on.</p>

<p>The print should be between blotting paper and
under pressure for about twenty minutes, after which
it is removed to a dish of hot water&mdash;almost as hot
as the hands can comfortably bear, say 100° to 120° F.</p>

<p>After lying in this for a few moments the dark
pigment will be seen to be oozing out from between the
two papers. When this has begun to come pretty freely
take one corner of the print and pull it away from the
transfer paper. It should come quite easily, and on being
peeled off entirely it is thrown away. We have now
the transfer paper bearing the printed film reversed, that
is, the side which was previously at the bottom and
next the original paper support, is now uppermost and
can therefore be got at.</p>

<p>If we splash it or lave it with the hand, using the
hot water, we shall soon see what happens. The
smudgy mass of pigment begins to wash away and the
picture gradually appears.</p>

<p>This constitutes development and we continue
working it with hot water until the whole is clear and
bright, being careful not to touch the film with fingers
or anything but water, for being in a very delicate and
soft condition it would be certain to sustain injury.</p>

<p>The hotter the water the greater its washing-off
action, and hence in cases of over-exposure very hot
water may go far to recover the print. When the desired
result is secured, transfer the print to a dish of cold
water, this instantly tends to slightly harden the film by
cooling it, and after two or three minutes it is passed
into a dish of alum and water, which further hardens it
and also "clears" the print of any bichromate salts<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0258" id="p0258">258</a></span>
which may still remain. In the alum bath the print
should remain until any sign of yellow stain has disappeared,
when after a final rinse of a few minutes in
cold water to remove the alum, the print may be hung
up to dry.</p>

<p>It will be seen that there is no prolonged washing
as with those processes in which hypo is employed, and
the print is absolutely permanent.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that in the
finished picture we are looking at the back of the printed
film as it received the light impressions from the negative,
and hence the image is reversed, that is, the left is
on the right and the right on the left. For landscape
and views this reversed position will probably be of no
importance, but if it is desired to have things right way
round&mdash;in portraits it will be essential&mdash;we must
either work from reversed negatives, or we must again
transfer the film which will then constitute a <i>double</i>
transfer. We shall now understand why previously we
called the paper to which the film was transferred <i>single</i>
transfer.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as it will be seen that the print is not on
paper, but consists of a transferable film of pigmented
gelatine, it will be understood that the paper employed
is merely a support to that film, hence it is customary to
speak of the paper as the support, whilst moreover it
maybe, and as often as not is ivory, glass, textile fabrics,
wood, or other substances.</p>

<p>If now we wish to again transfer the film so as to
correct the lateral reversal, we substitute for the single
transfer paper a "<i>temporary</i> support."</p>

<p>The temporary support which is to receive the
film merely whilst it is being developed, and with the
intention of its being subsequently transferred again to
a <i>final</i> support, may be paper or many other things.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0259" id="p0259">259</a></span>

<p>Moreover, remembering that the film is mainly
gelatine, it should be clear that whatever the nature of
the surface of the temporary support, the soft glutinous
film will take that surface just as we may make the
impression of a seal in sealing-wax.</p>

<p>The normal carbon print is shiny, due to the
gelatine, and so, if as a temporary support we were to
use ground glass or matt "opal," the carbon print film
would receive the fine granulated surface and give a
matted print as a result. This merely by the way as
suggesting an additional advantage offered by the double
transfer process as a set-off against the slight extra
trouble.</p>

<p>If double transfer is determined upon, and it is not
intended to experiment with ground glass, etc., then
when purchasing the carbon tissue, some <i>temporary</i>
support (sheets of paper coated with gelatine and shellac)
should be procured, also some pieces of <i>final</i> support.</p>

<p>Whatever the temporary support, it must receive
an application of waxing solution. This also may be
bought, or can be made of:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

<p>Melt the wax, add the resin, stir together and then add
the ether.</p>

<p>Pour a little of this mixture on to the temporary
support and spread with a tuft of cotton wool, and
rub over to make it even.</p>

<p>The final support for double transfer may be purchased,
and is made ready for use by soaking for ten
minutes in alum.</p>

<p>The temporary support, after being waxed and the
waxing solution having become dry, is to take the place
of the single transfer paper in every respect, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0260" id="p0260">260</a></span>
film developed as already described. When it has
reached the final washing, after the alum clearing bath,
it is brought into contact with the final support (which
has been for ten minutes in alum bath as just described)
and is removed to the glass or zinc plate and squeegeed.</p>

<p>It is now hung up to dry, and when quite dry the
blade of a knife should be inserted at one corner and the
temporary support gently pulled off.</p>

lengthy, and with this brief outline to form an introduction,
the reader who is a tyro will the better appreciate
the fuller description which follows.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to
practical details of
working, it may be as well
to realize what a piece of
carbon tissue is, and what
takes place in the process of
exposing such tissue to light.
Mr. J. W. Swan, who is to be
regarded as the inventor of
carbon process as we now
know it, was justified in
giving the name "tissue" to
the film of pigmented bichromatized
gelatine, as at first
it was a tissue unsupported
by paper backing and containing
pigment practically,
if not entirely, carbon. The
terms "carbon" and "tissue"
have been generally accepted
as describing a pigmented
paper containing permanent
colour, therefore little if any misunderstanding is
caused by such general description. The carbon
process, like other kindred methods, is based upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0262" id="p0262">262</a></span>
well-known hardening action of light upon a bichromate
salt in combination with organic matter. When paper
is coated with a mixture of gelatine pigment and a
bichromate salt, dried under favourable conditions and
exposed to light under a negative it naturally follows
that a positive image is produced. The negative acting
as a screen, prevents any undue hardening of such
portions of the picture as are intended to form the high-lights,
only slightly interfering with what are to be the
middle tints, and practically permitting full play in the
shadows. The latent image is imprinted on and into the
film of tissue compound with the most delicate portions
on the surface, and means must therefore be adopted to
protect the surface during the washing away of all parts
of the film not intended or desired to form any part of
the finished picture.<a name="FNanchor_A_7" id="FNanchor_A_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> In Swan's process this object
was secured by cementing the surface of the printed
tissue to its temporary support with rubber solution,
but after J. R. Johnson discovered that the printed
tissue would adhere without any cement to any surface
impervious to air and water simply by atmospheric
pressure, the same end was gained by soaking the
undeveloped print in water until about <i>half saturated</i>,
then bringing it into contact <i>under water</i> with either its
temporary or permanent support, slightly squeegeeing
or sponging to remove as much water as possible without<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0263" id="p0263">263</a></span>
injury to the print; as to <i>air</i>, <i>there ought not to be any
present</i> if care is taken to exclude it before lifting from the
water bath. The half-soaked tissue after mounting
absorbs every particle of water from between the surfaces,
and thus secures optical contact.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<hr class="fmini" />
<p><a name="Footnote_A_7" id="Footnote_A_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
It is generally asserted by non-practical carbon printers that
all portions of the film behind that which finally forms the print, are
unacted upon by light. That is to say, unchanged and quite as
soluble as if not printed at all. The upholders of such a theory
should try the following experiment:&mdash;Take a piece of tissue, cut it
through the centre, expose one piece, then mount both under
precisely similar conditions and wash in the same warm water
bath. Paying special attention to the backing papers, they will
find the one unacted upon by light will have parted with its load of
coloured material in much less time than the piece that formed the
backing of the print.</p></div>

<p>The squeegee, handy tool as it is, ought to be used
with great care, in no case with any degree of force, or
serious injury will result, particularly to the finer kinds
of work, such as double transfer prints of all kinds,
either on paper, ivory or opal. The rubber edge of the
squeegee should be free from notches, often caused by
contact with the sharp edges of glass plates. The
notches can be removed by rubbing on a sheet of glass
paper placed on a plane surface.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">TISSUE MAKING.</p>

<p>The tissue compound consists of a mixture of the
following ingredients:&mdash;Gelatine, sugar, pigment and
water. The proportions are of infinite variety according
to season, the nature of the pigment used, and the
purpose for which the tissue is intended. For convenience
it is the rule for tissue makers to prepare what is
termed stock jelly by dissolving, by the aid of a water
bath, gelatine and sugar in water, in varying proportions&mdash;roughly
speaking:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">

<div class="footnote">
<hr class="fmini" />
<p><a name="Footnote_A_8" id="Footnote_A_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
 For some purposes (instead of sugar), glycerine, sugar of
milk, or treacle may be substituted.</p></div>

<p>The pigments are made up into what are termed jelly
colours, which are ground either by hand on a slab of
glass, marble or granite, using a suitable muller for the
purpose, or when large quantities are required a paint
mill driven by steam or other power is employed. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0264" id="p0264">264</a></span>
hand grinding the colour is kept moist by syrup on
greatly reduced stock jelly. After grinding by hand the
pigment is lifted from the slab with a palette knife and
stirred into melted stock jelly. When the mill is used,
the pigment is mixed with the jelly before grinding.
The proportion of pigment to jelly varies enormously
according to the nature of the pigment, and may be
anything between 2&frac12; per cent. and 25 per cent. Having
prepared stock jelly and jelly colours, and allowed both
to set, they are weighed out in proper proportions, the
jelly being dissolved in a tin vessel placed in a water
bath. The colour, generally speaking, is dissolved in a
small proportion of the stock jelly placed in the mill and
again ground into the bulk of the jelly. In some cases
the pigment is dissolved in warm water and filtered
through cotton wool, fine felt or flannel. After adding
powdered recrystallized bichromate, the jelly compound
is ready for coating or spreading on the paper. The
coating may be done by hand or machine. Several
forms of machine are in use, including the first form
invented by Mr. Swan. When only a small quantity
is required, it is the general practice to coat by
hand.</p>

<p>In hand coating, the tissue compound may be
strained through fine muslin into a flat tin dish placed
on a water bath; the surface cleared of air bubbles by
dragging over it a strip of stiff paper. The sheet of
paper to be coated is held in an upright position at the
further end of the dish with its bottom edge just touching
the surface of the solution, gently lowered until the
whole surface of the sheet is in contact with the solution.
If the lowering is properly done there will not be any
default in contact, but if allowed to rest on the solution
a few moments, the presence of air bubbles, if any, will
be detected by the presence of little lumps on the back<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0265" id="p0265">265</a></span>
of the paper, these may be removed by raising a corner
and touching the spots with a finger tip. The sheet is
then raised with a rather slow and steady motion, allowed
to drip, then clipped to a line by its top corners and left to
dry in a warm dry room from which white light has been
excluded. When this method of coating is adopted it is
best to have the sheets of paper an inch longer than the
dish; the blank edge prevents contamination of the
fingers and distortion of the sheet caused by contraction
in drying. Another method of hand-coating is to roll the
sheet into a tube shape, placing the roll on the surface
of the jelly compound one and a half inches from the
top of the free end, raising with rather slow and
steady motion as before. When the second method
is chosen an oblong and somewhat deep dish will be
found better than the flat shape; the flat dish may
be used if tilted to give greater depth of solution in
a corner.</p>

<p>In the manufacture of tissues the greatest care must
be taken to avoid over or long-continued heating of the
gelatine solution. Either a too high temperature or a
lower temperature, long continued, destroys the solution
by rendering a considerable portion of it soluble in cold
water and to a great degree reducing its gelatinous
character.</p>

<p>The samples of gelatine used in tissue making are
of two kinds, although both of good quality they differ
in solubility, in hot weather a larger proportion of the
"hard" sample is used, in cold weather <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">INSENSITIVE TISSUES.</p>

<p>All insensitive tissues are made with a single sample
of hard gelatine. They are stocked by dealers and must
of necessity be fit for use at any season of the year, to
say nothing of those exported to hot climates.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0266" id="p0266">266</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">TRANSFER PAPERS.</p>

<p>Papers of many kinds are necessary for single
transfer prints, the tint of the paper must blend and
harmonize with the tone of the tissue or by contrasting
help to produce a pleasing effect. For prints of warm
tones such as red chalk, terra cotta and the various tints
of sepia, a yellowish or cream-toned paper forms the
most harmonious basis; the various tints of black, blue,
and purple look best on a slightly bluish-tinted paper.
For instance, a copy of an old engraving in tissue, of the
brown tone of the original would be utterly spoilt by a
blue-tinted basis. The above remarks apply only in a
limited degree to double transfer papers which in general
use are confined almost exclusively to portraiture. Such
papers are sometimes modified by tinting mauve, rose,
opal, etc., etc. Such tints are only in small demand and
are in all cases confined to papers coated with enamel
preparations. The best and most durable form of double
transfer paper is that prepared on fine chemically pure
paper with colourless gelatine and made insoluble by the
smallest possible quantity of chrome alum, entirely
without white or tinted pigment of any kind. The best
variety of double transfer paper only differs from the finest
form of single transfer paper in having on its surface a
rather thicker and softer coating of colourless gelatine.</p>

<p>All transfer papers, either for single or double
transfer, may be coated in the same way as tissue, with
the exception of those having a very rough surface. All
drawing papers and in fact all papers of very rough
surface are prepared by brushing over their surfaces
several coatings of a very thin solution of gelatine containing
a larger proportion of chrome alum or formalin
than is used in making ordinary single transfers. A flat
camel-hair brush is best for this form of coating, care
must be taken to avoid air bubbles.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0267" id="p0267">267</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">FLEXIBLE TEMPORARY SUPPORT.</p>

<p>Is paper coated with a gelatine solution in the
first instance, and after drying, again coated with an
aqueous solution of shellac.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">SENSITIZING THE TISSUE.</p>

<p>Pour the bichromate solution into a deep flat dish
(porcelain, ebonite, zinc, wood or tin) to the depth of
half an inch to an inch; place a sheet of tissue in it face
upwards, remove air-bubbles with a camel-hair brush or
soft sponge, using as little pressure as may be; turn the
sheet and remove bubbles formed on the paper, turn the
sheet again face upwards, and passing brush or sponge
gently over the surface, keep it evenly wet until it is
fairly limp; remove from the solution, place face downwards
on a perfectly clean glass or zinc plate, squeegee
to remove excess of solution, blot or wipe with a soft
cloth, remove any solution from the fingers, lift from the
plate, handle by edges only, clip to a line, small sizes by
one corner only, larger sheets by two corners, leaving a
little slackness between the two clips to allow for contraction
in drying, otherwise the sheet will be distorted
and difficult to press into contact with the negative.</p>

<p>The sensitizing <i>may</i> be done in ordinary daylight.
The drying <i>must</i> take place in a room from which actinic
light is excluded, and in a current of warm dry air, free
from impurities, such as the products of combustion
from burning gas, or an escape of sewer gas, etc., and at
a temperature not higher than 120° F. The drying
should be done as quickly as possible, otherwise the
tissue's keeping property will be greatly reduced, and in
all probability a thin film formed on the surface, of
insoluble gelatine, known to printers as "decomposed
tint," degrading the high-lights, and, except in the case
of very "hard" negatives, spoiling the work.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0268" id="p0268">268</a></span>

<p>It will be evident to anyone that the fancy forms of
sensitizing have been carefully avoided&mdash;floating on the
back, floating on the face, etc., etc. All the results
desired can be obtained by immersion. If a hard
negative has to be dealt with, a stronger solution, or
longer soaking in the bichromate solution, is all that is
needed; for weak negatives <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;In the dry frosty air of winter, sensitized
tissue will dry without heat, and continue soluble for a
considerable length of time, often as long as a month, or
even longer.</p>

<p>In hot weather it is recommended that the solution
of recrystallized bichromate be made immediately before
using, as in dissolving the crystals a considerable reduction
of temperature is produced. Should the temperature
then be over 60° F., ice must be used, not in the solution,
but roughly broken up and mixed with salt in an outer
vessel. If ice is placed in the bichromate bath allowance
must be made by keeping out part of the water. The
ice should be encased in several thicknesses of fine
muslin to prevent the solid impurities it generally contains
getting into the solution. When recrystallized
bichromate is not procurable, a few drops of liquid
ammonia added to solution of crude bichromate is recommended.
As bichromate is cheap, a fresh solution
should be made for each large batch of tissue.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PRINTING THE NEGATIVE.</p>

<p>Any negative that will yield a thoroughly good
albumen print is suitable for carbon work. The thinner
negatives now made for P.O.P. and similar processes are
less satisfactory for direct prints in carbon, for enlargements
and reproductions such negatives can be made to
yield most satisfactory results by modifying the transparency
and the enlarged or reproduced negative. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0269" id="p0269">269</a></span>
latitude in this direction is great. No matter how flat
the original negative may be, <i>if all the grades are present</i> it
can be manipulated in such a way that the most brilliant
result will be produced.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PREPARATION OF THE NEGATIVE FOR PRINTING.</p>

<p>The negative is prepared for printing as in all other
processes by removing all defects such as pinholes,
streaks, etc. For the carbon process the negative requires
to be further provided with what is termed a "<i>safe edge</i>;"
this is a line of black varnish, from one-eighth to half an
inch in width according to the sizes of the negatives,
painted on its margin, either on the film or glass side.
In the case of original negatives masks of opaque paper
are used instead of the painted edge, the masks having
openings cut in them slightly less than the size of the
negative. The purpose of the safe edge is to secure a
margin on which light has not acted, as such a margin
gives greater freedom to the operator in the process of
development by preventing the more deeply printed
portions of the picture leaving the support when the
backing paper is removed.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DOUBLE TRANSFER PRINTING.</p>

<p>It may be explained in a few words why an ordinary
(non-reversed) negative must be printed by double
transfer. In all other solar processes when the print is
removed from or taken off the face of the negative, it is
turned over to view, it therefore follows that the details
on the left side of the negative are found on the right
side of the positive print; with the carbon print no such
turning occurs, it is mounted upon its support in the
same position as it lay on the negative, developed in that
position from the back and leaving the position of objects<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0270" id="p0270">270</a></span>
the same as in the negative. In some cases this reversal
of the position of details is unimportant.</p>

<p>We will first consider the double transfer. In all
double transfer processes a temporary support must be
provided. Such supports are of two kinds, flexible and
rigid. When a matt-surface print on paper is required,
finely grained opal glass is used. For the enamelled
surface patent plate, for intermediate or only slightly
glazed surface, a flexible support is used. Flexible
support yields a surface similar to an albumen print
without special preparation. When the higher glaze of
the double-albumenized print is desired, the printed tissue
is coated with thin collodion before mounting on the
flexible support. Rigid supports, zinc or ground-glass
plates, have been used, but owing to the difficulty of
seeing the details during development their use is
practically discontinued. Flexible temporary support
is always used in transferring to canvas, wood panel,
opal, ivory, etc., etc. In the case of canvas, the double
transfer process has two great advantages. First, staining
is avoided, the bichromate has been thoroughly got rid
of in the process of development. Secondly, the canvas
is prepared to receive the print by a substratum that
allows the carbon image to expand and contract with
the expansion or contraction of the canvas and not in
opposition to it. There are also two advantages in
adopting the double transfer process for the production
of pictures on ivory. The first, is freedom from bichromate
stains. Secondly, the ivory is not distorted by washing
in hot water, such distortion generally takes place when
the single transfer process is adopted. Wood panels are
prepared in a similar way to canvas. Stains are avoided,
and as there is not the expansion and contraction of
canvas to provide against, the substratum is modified in
composition and greatly reduced. The stains above<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0271" id="p0271">271</a></span>
alluded to are caused by the chemical combination of
bichromate with the lead of the paint, forming chromate
of lead or chrome yellow. In the case of opal, opaque
celluloid, and similar substances, no staining takes
place, the double transfer is only required to restore the
image to its proper position.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">SINGLE TRANSFER.</p>

<p>The single transfer process is practically the only
method in use when large sizes or large numbers of
prints are required. For large sizes the negatives are
reversed in the process of enlargement. For small sizes
one or more reproduced reversed negatives are made,
either in the camera from a carbon transparency, or by
contact printing from a carbon transparency on a dry
plate. With reasonable care, little if any loss of quality
occurs in reproduction. As the single transfer process
is the most simple form of carbon printing, it is generally
recommended to beginners. Probably the most simple
form of all is single transfer on opal. The opal plate
does not require any preparation beyond cleaning.
Neither soap nor grease of any kind must be permitted
to contaminate the surface, otherwise the print will fail
to adhere. Opal plates are cleaned by scrubbing with
fine graining sand and water, and a muller or a small
plate, either of ordinary or opal glass, placed upon the
wetted sand and moved over the surface with a circular
motion until soiled or discoloured markings are ground
off.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">THE ACTINOMETER.</p>

<p>An actinometer must be used to gauge the amount
of exposure, as only a faint image, and in some tissues
none at all, is visible during or after exposure. The
simplest form of instrument is the best. That in general
use is known as Johnson's Actinometer, a square tin box<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0272" id="p0272">272</a></span>
containing a long strip of sensitive albumen paper, and
provided with a glass lid painted to the colour of printed
albumen paper, an opening in the paint in the form of a
slit three-sixteenths of an inch in width, from which the
paint has been removed. The strip of sensitive paper is
made to pass between the top of an inner lid and the
painted side of the glass lid underneath the clear slit with
the end of the strip protruding at one side of the box.
On exposure to light the sensitive silver paper gradually
discolours until it closely resembles the colour of the
paint, that is called one tint; the tint is changed by
pulling the slip forward just the width of the slit, and so
on until the requisite number of tints have been printed
for the strongest or densest negative in the batch exposed,
those negatives requiring less exposure are turned down
or removed when the requisite number of tints are
registered in each case.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">EXPOSURE.</p>

<p>For double transfer from opal the materials required
are opal plates, sensitive tissue, French chalk, collodion,
double transfer paper, pressure frame, flat camel-hair
brush, chamois leather. Before placing the negative in
pressure frame, carefully clean from both sides all finger
marks, etc., with the leather, place negative in frame on
a paper mask, or provided with a safe edge. After
exposure to light, remove from frame and develop on
plate prepared as follows:&mdash;Rub the whole surface with
French chalk on a pad of muslin, afterwards removing
loose particles by gentle brushing. Coat with collodion
made as follows:&mdash;Enamel collodion, 1 part; ether, 1
part; alcohol, 1 part. Filter and coat by pouring a pool
on centre of the plate, and, by tilting it, force the
collodion to flow into the top right corner, then to the
left, then to bottom left, and finally drain off at bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0273" id="p0273">273</a></span>
right corner, rocking the plate the while. The collodion
must be allowed to set until it will bear the gentle
pressure of a finger in its thickest part, but must not be
permitted to dry in any part before plunging into clean
cold water to remove the solvents by washing. The
time required in washing is variable according to time of
year. When the collodion ceases to repel water it is
ready to receive the printed tissue. Soak the tissue for
the requisite time, but not so long as to become quite
saturated, bring it into contact with collodionized side
of plate, remove to squeegeeing board, place over it a
piece of wet rubber cloth, or a piece of wet thick single
transfer paper, coated side up, to prevent injury to
exposed margin of collodion and to facilitate the smooth
passage of squeegee over the surface in removing excess
of water. If, on removing the covering from the plate,
the back of tissue is found to be unevenly wet, blot or
place plate in a rack to drain; in a few minutes develop
in warm water, temperature 90° to 100° F. Be careful
to remove the backing paper <i>under water</i>, <i>and as soon as
possible after immersion</i> in the warm bath. Finish development
by laving or pouring warm water over the print
from jug or other vessel, until all details are brought out.
When washing is finished the print should look rather
light, as in drying a decided increase in strength is
obtained; rinse <i>slightly</i> in alum solution to stop bleeding
only, place in clean cold water to wash out any remains
of bichromate, thoroughly rinse by dashing water upon
the print to remove any particles of solid matter that
may have stuck to its surface; place in a rack to dry,
and transfer as soon after drying as possible. The
transfer paper is cut a trifle larger than the net size of
the print, but less than the opal support; it is soaked in
warm water until the surface is slimy to the touch, but
not soft enough to break under pressure between finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0274" id="p0274">274</a></span>
and thumb. The softened transfer paper is placed in
clean cold water into which the dry print is plunged,
water dashed upon its surface to remove air; the two
surfaces are brought into contact under water, and
squeegeed into contact as in first mounting before
development. When thoroughly dry, the print may be
removed from the opal plate by inserting the point of a
knife at the edge.</p>

<p>Double transfer prints with enamelled surface are
produced precisely as above, only substituting patent
plate for ground opal, and by adding a second thickness
of paper to the back of the finished print before removal
from its temporary support.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DOUBLE TRANSFER FROM FLEXIBLE

<p>After dissolving, mix the two solutions, pour a little
of the mixture on fine flannel, rub it over so as to
evenly moisten the surface of the flexible support,
wipe off with a second flannel using only slight pressure
but rubbing briskly and with circular <i>motion</i>. When
finished, the waxed surface should be perfectly even
and quite free from streaks or other markings.
The waxing should be done some considerable time
before the support is required for use, and exposed
to the free action of air to remove all trace of the
solvents.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0275" id="p0275">275</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">PAPER PRINTS WITH ORDINARY OR
SLIGHTLY GLAZED SURFACE.</p>

<p>After removal from the pressure frame, the tissue is
plunged into cold water with a piece of support slightly
larger. After soaking the necessary time, the prepared
surfaces are brought into contact under water, removed
from the bath and placed upon any even plane surface,
such as zinc, glass, etc., squeegeed into contact, blotted
or otherwise treated to remove uneven dampness, and
developed in warm water as in double transfer from rigid
support, then slightly rinsed in alum solution and washed
in clean cold water until all traces of bichromate are
removed. After the transferring is done as before
described, only the print on flexible support must be
soaked in water until quite flat before bringing into
contact with its final support.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PAPER PRINTS WITH HIGHLY GLAZED
SURFACE.</p>

<p>The printed tissue after removal from the pressure
frame is coated with collodion, for this coating allowance
must be made in printing. A considerable reduction in
temperature takes place and any moisture present in the
air is condensed on the tissue, bringing into action the
well-known effect of continued moisture, <i>i.e.</i>, considerably
increasing the depth of the print. Great care must be
taken to coat evenly and to prevent the collodion running
in streaks on the back of the print. When such streaks
or unevenness of any kind are present, a corresponding
dark line or lines will be found on the face of the
finished print. Transfer same as for prints with
ordinary surface. All prints from flexible support on
paper with a highly glazed surface as well as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0276" id="p0276">276</a></span>
intended for transfer to ivory or opal are coated with

<p class="center">DOUBLE TRANSFER TO OPAL AND IVORY.</p>

<p>After development the print is allowed to dry, and

final support, whether opal or ivory, by a solution of
gelatine composed of the following ingredients:&mdash;</p>

<p>Soak the gelatine in the water until quite limp, dissolve
by heat, then add the 30 grain chrome alum solution;

muslin into a flat dish on a water bath. After cutting
the print to a size a trifle less than opal or ivory, place
both print and final support in gelatine solution, allow
print to stretch until quite flat, then bring them into
contact under solution, squeegee and place on edge to dry.
When quite dry, remove temporary support by inserting
the point of a knife between the surfaces at the edge,
wash with benzol or ether to remove all traces of the
waxing solution. The print is now ready for the artist.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">DOUBLE TRANSFER PRINTS ON CANVAS.</p>

<p>For double transfer prints on canvas, as a basis for
oil painting, there is not at the present moment a large
demand. A strong prejudice exists, and deservedly so,
against such prints, for the following reasons. Some
thirty years ago, in the principal establishment in
which carbon work was done, a process of printing on
canvas was in vogue. It was roughly this:&mdash;A stretched
artist's canvas without other preparation was coated
with dammar varnish; after drying, the canvas was<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0277" id="p0277">277</a></span>
used in pretty much the same way as single transfer
paper is now&mdash;that is to say, a piece of printed tissue
was squeegeed into contact with its surface, developed
by floating on hot water, and practically in that crude
condition placed in the hands of artists for oil-colour
painting or finishing as it is sometimes prudently called.
The natural result followed&mdash;<i>viz.</i>, in a dry warm room
the canvas stretched, the film of unmodified gelatine
contracted; hence cracks, peeling, etc., until the work,
valuable or otherwise, was utterly ruined. The
method of preparing the canvas for the reception of
the carbon image introduced by the writer is based
upon opposite principles, as mentioned in the preceding
general remarks, and may be described as follows:&mdash;A
yielding and elastic substratum of gelatine forms
a crust, so to speak, that expands and contracts
according to the corresponding behaviour of the canvas
support.</p>

<p>Ordinary painted canvas, such as is used by
artists, or strong linen may be used with special
treatment.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PREPARATION OF PAINTED CANVAS.</p>

<p>The canvas is first stretched tightly on a drawing
board, same size as picture required, the greater part of
paint removed by scrubbing with soda solution (either
nail brush, sponge or a piece of flannel will answer the
purpose) until the surface of the fabric is exposed and
little of the paint remains beyond the priming. After
drying, the canvas is coated with the following solution,
applied with a flat camel-hair brush. Several coats
(three in cold, four in warm weather) are given, drying
between each and rubbing with fine sand paper if at all
uneven.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0278" id="p0278">278</a></span>

		<td class="tdr">1</td>
		<td class="tdc">"</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The print is exposed in the ordinary manner,
developed on temporary support, allowed to dry and
transferred to the canvas as follows:&mdash;The canvas is
placed face upwards, on a level surface by preference,
on a broad board over a large tank. The dry print is
placed face upwards in a flat dish, the warm coating
solution poured over it, air bells removed with the brush,
the surface of the canvas brushed over with the solution.
The bulk of the solution is then poured on the canvas
and before it has had time to run off the print is lowered
carefully and quickly upon it and squeegeed to remove
excess of solution. After thorough drying, the temporary
support is removed, the surface of the print cleaned with
benzol or ether or a mixture of both to remove every trace
of the waxing compound, and mounted on a stretcher in
the usual manner. A print on canvas prepared as above,
is perfectly reliable, it will neither crack nor peel, and
can be used with perfect confidence as a basis for the
most costly form of artistic finishing, as the carbon image
rests upon an elastic substratum in actual contact with
the fibrous substance of the canvas.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">TO PREPARE ORDINARY STRONG LINEN
OR CALICO.</p>

<p>Proceed precisely as for painted canvas (of course
without scrubbing), using the same coating solution with
half-a-pound white pigment added, sulphate of baryta
answers perfectly. Sand or glass paper must be used
pretty freely as the surface of the unpainted fabric washes
up roughly when the gelatine coatings are applied.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0279" id="p0279">279</a></span>

<br />
<p class="center">WOOD PANELS.</p>

<p>Wood panels are prepared by removing the surface
of the paint only with soda solution. After drying, a
tooth is given by rubbing with fine sand paper and
coating with solution as under:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Before transferring to either kinds of canvas
or wood panel in cold weather, it is absolutely necessary
to thoroughly warm the final support, otherwise the
gelatine solution will gelatinize before the excess can
be removed from between the surfaces.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">THE SINGLE TRANSFER PROCESS.</p>

<p>The single transfer process may be briefly described
as follows:&mdash;The sensitive tissue is exposed under a
negative and the exposure gauged by actinometer as for
double transfer printing. After removal from the pressure
frame the printed tissue is plunged into clean cold water
along with a piece of transfer paper of any desired
surface or quality, cut a little larger than the tissue (to
provide a margin by which the picture may be handled
without injury during development). After soaking the
requisite time, the two prepared surfaces are brought
into contact under the water, removed to a squeegeeing
board, plate of glass or zinc, and squeegeed into contact;
care must be taken to use only as much pressure as is
needed to remove the superfluous water from between
the surfaces. A sponge may be used instead of a
squeegee, or both may be dispensed with, if care is taken
to remove every trace of air from surfaces before lifting
from the cold water bath. When neither squeegee or
substitute for it is used, the print must be handled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0280" id="p0280">280</a></span>
greater care, as undue bending before atmospheric
pressure comes into operation would destroy contact.
The print is hung up to drain, and more time allowed
between mounting and development. Development is
the same as in double transfer, with one or two rather
important exceptions. 1st. The single transfer print is
developed upon the material on which it is to remain.
2nd. There is no preparation of the supports, neither in
the case of paper or opal. 3rd. The developed print can
be soaked for a considerable time in a saturated solution
of alum without injury, the alum solution greatly
assisting in removing bichromate.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">CARBON TRANSPARENCIES.</p>

<p>Carbon transparencies, either for projection, enlargement,
or reproduction, are printed in a special tissue
known as transparency tissue, and developed on glass
plates prepared with a thin coating of fine hard gelatine.
The coating solution is composed as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="formula" summary="formula">
	<tr>
		<td class="tdl" style="width: 12em;">Gelatine</td>
		<td class="tdr">&frac34;</td>
		<td class="tdl">oz.</td>
 	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Water</td>
		<td class="tdr">40</td>
		<td class="tdc">"</td>
	</tr><tr>
		<td class="tdl">Bichromate potash</td>
		<td class="tdr">1</td>
		<td class="tdl">dram.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>The glass plates are carefully selected, free from
bells, scratches, and other defects; thoroughly cleaned,
either by acid or rubbing with plate powder to remove
every trace of grease, and then coated with the gelatine
solution, and placed in a rack to dry; when dry, exposed
to light to render the film somewhat insoluble. It is not
desirable to print until the film is absolutely hardened
throughout. The print adheres firmly to the plate when
the substratum is not over-printed.</p>

<p>A positive intended for projection should show clear
glass in the highest lights without undue density in the
shadows, all details plainly seen&mdash;in a word, quite
transparent.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0281" id="p0281">281</a></span>

<p>Positives intended for enlargement must be fully
exposed&mdash;that is to say, every detail on the highest lights
brought out, but no more; beyond that point there is
nothing to be gained. Over-printing in the transparency
tends to bury detail in the shadows of the enlarged
negative, and to blend the highest grades in the high-lights,
reducing the roundness or modelling of the
picture.</p>

<p>In the case of very hard negatives intended for
enlargement, the usual treatment is to sun the whole
surface of the transparency in order to secure detail in
the high-lights. A moment's consideration will convince
any practical printer that nothing but injury to the final
print can result from such treatment of the transparency.
The high-lights are degraded, the details in the shadows
further buried. The better method is to make an extra
special transparency tissue, for the printing of such hard
negatives, containing a greatly reduced proportion of
pigment to gelatine. Such a tissue permits greater
depth of printing, retains all details in the shadows and
high-lights, and, in fact, enables the enlarger to produce
a negative that will yield a thoroughly satisfactory print.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">REPRODUCED NEGATIVES.</p>

<p>In making reproduced negatives from hard originals,
ordinary transparency tissue will serve every purpose. The
transparency is printed in the usual way, and developed
on a prepared glass plate; when dry a negative is printed
from the transparency without special treatment and
also developed on glass, when a decided reduction of
density will be found to have taken place. The reproduced
negative will possess all the good qualities of the
original, plus improved printing quality. It is only in
the case of extremely hard negatives that the extra
special tissue is required.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="p0282" id="p0282">282</a></span>

<p>If a perfect reproduction of an original negative is
required, the transparency must be printed either in
very weak light or in direct sunlight. Either method
gives a brighter image than that produced in ordinary
diffused daylight. The same method must be adopted
in printing the negative.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Care must be taken when direct sunlight is
used to see that the pressure frame and everything in
and about it is thoroughly dry, otherwise the tissue may
stick to the negative, spoiling the print and probably the
negative also. It must also be noted that two tints,
printed in direct sunlight, although of apparently the
same depth, mean quite as much as three such tints
printed in diffused light.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">FAILURES AND DEFECTS: THEIR CAUSES AND CURE.</p>

<p>As a rule, failures in working the carbon process
are caused, as in most other cases of failure, by
imperfect <i>knowledge of the substances and nature of the
ingredients used in the process</i>. Before going into further
detail, it may be as well to point out that a great deal of
misunderstanding has been caused, by writers on this
subject&mdash;that may be fairly termed "blind leaders of
the blind." With only slight knowledge of the subject
they have misled beginners by assuring them that the
process is simplicity itself, in fact the most simple photographic
printing process extant. Up to a certain point,
and to that certain point only, is such description true.
There are no subtle chemical combinations, no mixing
and maturing of toning or other solutions. But&mdash;and in
this case there is great virtue in the <i>but</i>&mdash;the greatest
care is not only required, it is absolutely demanded, in
manipulation. A carbon print from start to finish is
probably subject to more chances of injury than any<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0283" id="p0283">283</a></span>
other form of print in existence. When this fact has
been fully grasped by the novice, and he has been
thoroughly prepared for the difficulties before him, the
rest is plain sailing. Care, and care only; nothing
beyond. He who wishes to succeed in carbon work
must pay infinite attention to every small matter of
detail as far as such detail relates to manipulation, otherwise
he will only succeed in achieving failure.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">FRILLING AND RETICULATIONS.</p>

<p>Frilly reticulations are generally caused by over-soaking
the tissue before development, or failing to
provide protection of the clear portions of the margin of
the negative by a safe edge.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">SPOTS ON THE FINISHED PRINT.</p>

<p>Spots are generally caused by solid particles of grit
or other impurities being allowed to find their way into
the water in the process of development, or, as in the
case of certain peculiar circular spots that often deface the
carbon print, such spots are caused by small fragments
of tissue broken from the edges in cutting, which, being
of the same colour as the prepared surface of the tissue
and exceedingly small, often escape notice. They adhere
most tenaciously to the surface of the tissue, and if not
removed before the print is mounted upon its temporary
or final support, cause the mischief referred to; being
confined between two surfaces they cannot escape, but
are dissolved by the water used in developing the print,
swell and make a circular patch, often greatly injuring
the picture.</p>

<p>Spots of a different character are produced in
quite an opposite direction. Instead of being black
they are light, in groups each spot having a dark
rim on the outside. They generally occur in under<span class="pagenum"><a name="p0284" id="p0284">284</a></span>-exposed
prints, and are formed by fine particles of air
imprisoned between the coating of gelatine and the paper
support. When the tissue is mounted for development
and placed in warm water, the fine particles of air swell,
and not being able to escape from between the surfaces,
impress themselves into the yielding portions of the
printed tissue and make the marks above referred to,
unless the printing has been deep enough to allow of
their removal before development is completed.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">CAUSE OF FAILURES IN THE SECOND TRANSFER.</p>

<p>Other causes of failure refer particularly to prints
by double transfer, either to paper, opal, ivory, canvas
or wood panel or any similar surfaces.</p>

<p>Such failures are generally produced by <i>soap</i>, <i>fat</i>, or
<i>any kind</i> of greasy substances being permitted to find
their way into the water in which such prints have been
manipulated previous to their final transfer. Another
point should be mentioned: the sooner a print intended
for second transfer is finished the better the result will be.</p>

<br />
<p class="center">PRESSURE MARKS.</p>

<p>Pressure marks are caused by using damp tissue or
damp pads in the pressure frame. It is recommended
that a piece of waterproof material, such as mackintosh
cloth, be placed between the tissue and the padding, and
that the pads be as smooth and free from grain as
possible. It will be found on close examination that the
mottled, spotty appearance, known as pressure marks,
closely resemble the texture of the pads behind the
tissue.</p>
